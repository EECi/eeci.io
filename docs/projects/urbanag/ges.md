# Ongoing research

Growing Underground

Monitoring is currently under way at the Growing Underground facility in Clapham, London, to record temperature, humidity and CO2 levels. This visionary facility aims to bring edible crop production to the heart of the city, using the disused WW2 Deep Shelter sites, thereby minimising the carbon impact of food transportation. The monitored data is being used to develop and validate a Greenhouse Energy Simulation model for the prediction of the energy consumption of the site.

# Completed research

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew

RBG Kew Palm House

A retrofit study of the buildings at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, highlighted the need to incorporate the heat and mass transfer associated with plant transpiration into the dynamic building energy simulation for the ornamental glasshouses. A simulation tool has been developed for the analysis of such glasshouses and has been used in conjunction with DELORES and DENO to complete a district energy analysis of the RBG Kew site, incorporating building retrofit in addition to optimisation of district energy supply options.

This study was supported by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the  Daphne Jackson Trust.
