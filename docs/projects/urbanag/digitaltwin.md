# Growing Underground

Farm 33m below ground developed by Zero Carbon Farms. 

# Digital twin concept

While vertical farming can be energy intensive, we are interested to find ways of making the farm operate more energy efficiently by better understanding the farm environment and giving advice in real-time. Combining GU's innovative and open to learn growing methods with regular data analysis, we found that GU's yield effieicny increased on average by 57% over five years.

Having learned what makes crops grow better as a function of the environment, and developed models to forecast internal environmental conditions, we started prototyping a digital twin of the farm. 

We've identified three stages to the development of digital twins which are as essential as each other. This section will go through each stage and how they applied to GU.

## Data creation

## Data analysis

## Data modelling



# Use of digital twin

Once the models have been made, the challenge is delivering the results in real-time to yield observable results. We're still developing this.
