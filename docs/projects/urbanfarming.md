This project contains three sections

# Greenhouse Energy Simulator

A GES model was developed

# Digital twin of an urban farm

We have been working in collaboration with ATI to develop a real-time digital twin of the farm.

# Co-simulation of greenhouses in buildings

Hydroponics can be a lot more efficient when conventional greenhouse agriculture, especially when developed in symbiosis with urban resources. To quantify this, we developed a co-simulation methodology.
