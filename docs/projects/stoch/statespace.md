**Overview**

The project aims to build efficient tools for assisting the decarbonization of buildings. Two main types of energy representations are analytical models such as FEA, which can be computationally demanding, or fully data-driven models such as polynomial regression or neural network, whose fidelity depends heavily on the size of the dataset and additionally, the underlying structure can be difficult to interpret. 

Thus, we are in need of better methods for representing energy behavior of spaces: require less data to build without compromising fidelity and are interpretable. 

This project investigates the resuse of systems
