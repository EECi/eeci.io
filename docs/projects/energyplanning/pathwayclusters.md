# Context

Understanding urban residential energy use and clean energy transitions requires understanding and characterising heterogeneity across households arising due to differences in socio-economic and cultural context. This research has looks into the use of mixed data and clustering methods to identify distinct typologies or pathways for transition to clean cooking fuel use by low-income households in urban India.
