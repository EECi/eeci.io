# Context

Understanding urban residential energy use and clean energy transitions requires understanding and characterising heterogeneity across households arising due to differences in socio-economic and cultural context. This research has looks into the use of mixed data and clustering methods to identify distinct typologies or pathways for transition to clean cooking fuel use by low-income households in urban India.

<h2 class="title">Using qualitative and quantitative data</h2>
 Understanding factors that influence energy use in urban areas involves characterising complex socio-economic and cultural factors and effects. Not all of these are easily captured or analysed using quantitative methods. Qualitative methods commonly used in the social sciences including the analysis of qualitative in-depth interviews can reveal nuances and important decision making context that cannot be identified through quantitative methods. However these qualitative methods can be difficult to scale up in the same way as quantitative analysis.<br>

  We sought to combine the both quantitative and qualitative data in our approach to leverage the benefits of analysis of each individually.
