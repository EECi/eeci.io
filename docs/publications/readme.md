# Publications

The file EECi_bib.bib contains all the publications produced by the group.

Please add any papers you publish to this file.

To link to this file on individual people pages use the following text (replace 'Ward' with your own name):

```html
<div>
<script src="https://bibbase.org/show?bib=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FEECi%2Fhome%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Fpublications%2FEECi_bib.bib&commas=true&jsonp=1&amp;filter=author_short:Ward&amp;folding=1"></script> 
</div>
```

This is the recommended usage. You can place your own personal bib file in this directory if you wish to list your previous publications.
