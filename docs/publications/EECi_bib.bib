abstract = "Abstract Amongst academics and practitioners working in the fields of urban planning and design, there has been an on-going discussion regarding the relationships between urban morphology and environmental sustainability. A main focus of analysis has been to investigate whether the form of cities and neighbourhoods can be related to their energy efficiency, especially regarding the energy intensity of buildings and transportation. However, to analyse the overall energy performance of urban systems, both the consumption and the generation of resources need to be assessed. In terms of urban environmental sustainability, the potential to generate renewable energy within the city boundaries is a research topic of growing interest, being solar energy one of the main resources available. This study uses neighbourhood-scale statistical models to explore the relationships between aggregated urban form descriptors and the potential to harvest solar energy within the city. Different possible scenarios of urban morphology in Greater London are analysed and variables of urban form are tested with the aim of increasing the solar energy potential of neighbourhoods. Results show that by optimising combinations of up to eight variables of urban form the solar irradiation of roofs could be increased by ca. 9%, while that of faÃ§ades could increase by up to 45%. Furthermore, based on these results, a series of trade-offs needed for the optimisation of conflicting variables is unveiled. Finally, some recommendations for design strategies are offered with the aim of helping urban planners and designers improve the solar energy potential of new or existing urban areas. "

  title={Forecasting Passenger Fleet Fuel Consumption--A New Methodology to Include Uncertainty Analysis},
  author={Martin, Niall PD and Bishop, Justin DK and Choudhary, Ruchi and Boies, Adam M},
  booktitle={Transportation Research Board 94th Annual Meeting},
  abstract={The UK's light duty vehicle fleet is the largest end user of refined petroleum, accounting for 12.5% of national UK CO2 emissions in 2010. Despite this, current fleet turnover and fuel consumption models do not account for advances in engine technologies, and are unable to account for uncertainties when used to forecast future fleet fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. This paper introduces a methodology for determining new car fleet fuel consumption based on vehicle design metrics, and accounts for uncertainties inherent in such predictions using a Bayesian statistical framework. Sources of uncertainty are also listed and quantified, while the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) shown to underestimate on-road fuel consumption in Spark and Compression Ignition vehicles by 14% and 17%, respectively. A Bayesian fuel consumption model attributes these discrepancies to the NEDCï¿½s misrepresentation of rolling, frictional and aerodynamic resistances, while on-road fuel consumption estimates were derived using inputs for the engine size, vehicle mass, and compression ratio. The likely 2020 on-road fuel consumption of the average SI and CI vehicles was estimated to be 6.5 L/100 km and 5.8 L/100 km, respectively, which represents a 21% and 16% reduction over the average 2011 NEDC estimate. These forecasts exceed the mandatory fuel equivalent emissions standards set for that year, highlighting the need for more stringent technological developments to ensure vehicle manufacturers meet emissions targets.},

abstract = "Abstract Vehicle manufacturers are required to reduce their European sales-weighted emissions to 95 g CO2/km by 2020, with the aim of reducing on-road fleet fuel consumption. Nevertheless, current fuel consumption models are not suited for the European market and are unable to account for uncertainties when used to forecast passenger vehicle energy-use. Therefore, a new methodology is detailed herein to quantify new car fleet fuel consumption based on vehicle design metrics. The New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) is shown to underestimate on-road fuel consumption in Spark (SI) and Compression Ignition (CI) vehicles by an average of 16% and 13%, respectively. A Bayesian fuel consumption model attributes these discrepancies to differences in rolling, frictional and aerodynamic resistances. Using projected inputs for engine size, vehicle mass, and compression ratio, the likely average 2020 on-road fuel consumption was estimated to be 7.6 L/100 km for \{SI\} and 6.4 L/100 km for \{CI\} vehicles. These compared to \{NEDC\} based estimates of 5.34 L/100 km (SI) and 4.28 L/100 km (CI), both of which exceeded mandatory 2020 fuel equivalent emissions standards by 30.2% and 18.9%, respectively. The results highlight the need for more stringent technological developments for manufacturers to ensure adherence to targets, and the requirements for more accurate measurement techniques that account for discrepancies between standardised and on-road fuel consumption.

We produce an inventory of \{UK\} airport emissions ï¿½?? including emissions from aircraft landing and takeoff operations, aircraft auxiliary power units (APUs) and ground support equipment (GSE) ï¿½?? with quantified uncertainty. Emissions due to more than 95% of \{UK\} passenger enplanements are accounted for. We apply a multi-scale air quality modelling approach to assess the airÂ&nbsp;quality impacts of \{UK\} airports. Using a concentration-response function we estimate that 110 (90% CI: 72ï¿½??160) early deaths occur in the \{UK\} each year (based on 2005 data) due to \{UK\} airport emissions. We estimate that up to 65% of the health impacts of \{UK\} airports could be mitigated by desulphurising jet fuel, electrifying GSE, avoiding use of \{APUs\} and use of single engine taxiing. Two plans for the expansion of \{UK\} airport capacity are examined ï¿½?? expansion of London Heathrow and new hub airport in the Thames Estuary. Even if capacity is constrained, we find that the health impacts of \{UK\} airports still increases by 170% in 2030 due to an increasing and aging population, increasing emissions, and a changing atmosphere. We estimate that if Heathrow were to be expanded as per previous \{UK\} Government plans, UK-wide health impacts in 2030 would increase by 4% relative to the 2030 constrained case, but this increase could become a 48% reduction if emissions mitigation measures were employed. We calculate that 24% of UK-wide aviation-attributable early deaths could be avoided in 2030 if Heathrow were replaced by a new airport in Thames Estuary because the location is downwind of London, where this reduction occurs notwithstanding the increase in aircraft emissions. A Thames hub airport would (isolated from knock-on effects at other airports) cause 60ï¿½??70% fewer early deaths than an expanded Heathrow, or 55ï¿½??63% fewer early deaths than an unexpanded Heathrow. Finally, replacing Heathrow by a Thames Estuary airport combined with emissions mitigation measures would reduce UK-wide aviation-attributable early deaths by 56% in 2030 while increasing aircraft movements, which would represent aviation causing about the same level of adverse health impacts as today in absolute terms. We note that because aviation emissions are included in the \{EU\} Emissions Trading Scheme, all options are CO2-neutral in terms of direct emissions (but not climate-neutral). "

    abstract = { Geothermal energy is an efficient low carbon solution for the heating and cooling of buildings. For many megacities such as London and Beijing, the amount of energy that can be stored in the urban local subsurface is greater than their annual heating and cooling demands. The ground source heat pump (GSHP) system ï¿½ a shallow geothermal technology that provides heating and cooling for buildings by continuously replenishing the energy in the subsurface ï¿½ has been used increasingly in recent years, but its application has been generally limited to single buildings. In this study, a geographic information system-based simulation model was developed to estimate how many GSHPs could be installed at the city scale without losing control of the ground thermal capacity and to evaluate the degree to which such a system could contribute to the energy demands of buildings in a city. The model was built by embedding a Python-based GSHP design code into ArcGIS software and was trialled on the City of Westminster, a borough in London, UK, as a case study under the two scenarios of boreholes placed under buildings and boreholes around buildings. Under both scenarios, the model produced borehole allocation maps and ratio of capacity to demand maps. The results show that a large proportion of buildings could support their own heating demands through GSHPs and, through a well-organised district heating system, GSHPs may be used efficiently to satisfy heating demands throughout an urban area. }

Additionally, since this might have an effect on the electricity use on an aggregate of households a large-scale introduction of \{EV\} charging and \{PV\} power production in the entire city of Westminster is also investigated. Household electricity consumption and \{EV\} home-charging are modeled with a Markov-chain model. \{PV\} power production is estimated from solar irradiation data from Meteonorm for the location of Westminster combined with a model for photovoltaic power production on tilted planes. The available rooftop area is estimated from the \{UK\} map geographic information database. \{EV\} home-charging increases the household electricity use mainly during evening with a maximum during winter whereas \{PV\} produces power during daytime with maximum during summer. On the household level this mismatch introduces variability in power consumption/production, which is shown to be less prominent for the large-scale scenario of the entire city of Westminster. "

City of Westminster, in London, is used as a case study to identify and map areas where \{GSHPs\} can serve as a viable option for heating and/or cooling. A parametric study has been conducted to investigate the influence of how space heating and cooling demand is quantified on the potential utility of \{GSHP\} systems. The influence of \{COP\} variation during operation is also examined. The operational variation of \{COP\} influences the electricity consumption of the \{GSHP\} systems. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis including the capital cost, C/D ratio distribution, energy demand, and financial risk is highly recommended for district-level planning of \{GSHP\} systems. "

abstract = { The last decade has seen a surge in the need for uncertainty analysis (UA) for building energy assessment. The rigorous determination of uncertainty in model parameters is a vital but often overlooked part of UA. To undertake this, one has to turn one's attention to a thriving area in engineering statistics that focuses on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for short. This paper applies dedicated methods and theories that are emerging in this area of statistics to the field of building energy models, and specifically to the microclimate variables embedded in them. We argue that knowing the uncertainty in these variables is a vital prerequisite for ensuing UA of whole building behaviour. Indeed, significant discrepancies have been observed between the predicted and measured state variables of building microclimates. This paper uses a set of approaches from the growing UQ arsenal, mostly regression-based methods, to develop statistical models that quantify the uncertainties in the following most significant microclimate variables: local temperature, wind speed, wind pressure and solar irradiation. These are the microclimate variables used by building energy models to define boundary conditions that encapsulate the interaction of the building with the surrounding physical environment. Although our analysis is generically applicable to any of the current energy models, we will base our UQ examples on the energy model used in EnergyPlus. },

abstract = { Greenhouses contain physical processes of heat and mass transfer that are not accounted for in typical building energy simulation programs, especially those involving the interaction between plants and the indoor environment. This includes convective, radiative, as well as latent heat exchange. The primary aim of this paper is to investigate modelling strategies for analyzing the historic greenhouses at the Kew Botanical Gardens in London for the purpose of evaluating appropriate retrofits for energy savings. Two modelling and simulation paradigms are explored in this paper: A general greenhouse model, adapted from the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM) of Pieters and Deltour, is implemented in two independent platforms, one being algorithmic MATLAB code and the other being the acausal declarative modelling language Modelica. The paper describes the key differences between the two modelling paradigms in terms of following features: (a) adequate elucidation of the physical behaviour, (b) numerical behaviour of the model in terms of stability, (c) flexibility for model improvements and extensions, (d) relevance to retrofit objectives. Results from the two models are compared to measured data from the particular greenhouse. These comparisons help understand the relative accuracy of the two models and are also indicative of areas where model resolution needs improvements.}

abstract={This paper proposes an appliance scheduling scheme for residential building energy management controllers, by taking advantage of the time-varying retail pricing enabled by the two-way communication infrastructure of the smart grid. Finite-horizon scheduling optimization problems are formulated to exploit operational flexibilities of thermal and non-thermal appliances using a model predictive control (MPC) method which incorporates both forecasts and newly updated information. For thermal appliance scheduling, the thermal mass of the building, which serves as thermal storage, is integrated into the optimization problem by modeling the thermodynamics of rooms in a building as constraints. Within the comfort range modeled by the predicted mean vote (PMV) index, thermal appliances are scheduled smartly together with thermal mass storage to hedge against high prices and make use of low-price time periods. For non-thermal appliance scheduling, in which delay and/or power consumption flexibilities are available, operation dependence of inter-appliance and intra-appliance is modeled to further exploit the price variation. Simulation results show that customers have notable energy cost savings on their electricity bills with time-varying pricing. The impact of customers' preferences of appliances usage on energy cost savings is also evaluated.},

abstract = { This paper proposes a methodology to develop an urban scale model of energy use of buildings. this methodology addresses the diversity in energy use through two approaches: classification of the building stock and archetype modelling; supported by Bayesian calibration. The Bayesian approach allows quantification of uncertainties in model input parameters.  We designed a hierarchical calibration so that uncertain input model parameters are calibrated for different time resolutions of analysis. We validated the calibration process by applying it to a food supermarket building stock in a region as a case study. The results generally showed that the proposed approach enables urban scale models to take into account not only the overall characteristics of the building stock represented by annual energy consumption but also the influence of meteorological conditions shown in the variation of weekly energy consumption}

The system includes 192 thermal-piles underneath the building foundations and two open-well heat exchangers. The GSHP system was simulated using the TRNSYS energy simulation platform. A conventional borehole model based on the 'Duct Ground Heat Storage Model' was used to model the thermal-piles. The results of the model matched to within ï¿½11% of actual performance data collected from the system over a period of eight months. The borehole model can be used to simulate the performance of thermal-piles, provided that the piles are of an equal length and are spaced within a uniform grid. The results show that although the GSHP system significantly reduces energy consumption, with the current gas and electricity prices in the UK, operational costs for the GSHP system are higher than those of a conventional heating and cooling system.}

However, the Green Deal proposals have the potential to generate financial risk, due to a possible overestimation of the energy savings arising from retrofit measures. This paper proposes a framework for handling the uncertainties associated with the prediction of these energy savings, as well as demonstrating how decisions can be made in the face of the uncertainties involved in the retrofit analysis of a housing stock. The proposed framework is applied to a case study set of dwellings and it is seen that a limited range of measures will be cost-effective under the Green Deal proposals for these dwellings; as a result, subsidies will be required if higher impact measures are to be considered viable. Finally, however, it is also seen that the monetary value of additional societal benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions and improved thermal comfort, is likely to more than outweigh the cost of any subsidies.",

    abstract = { The spatial variability of gas consumption is investigated in non-domestic buildings across districts of Greater London, UK. It is argued that the energy consumption of a building is to some extent influenced by where the building is located in a city, due to contextual features of its own district as well as those of neighbouring districts. Using Bayesian spatial models, the analysis suggests the energy consumption due to the influence of district features can be quantified and dissociated from the energy consumption associated with the physical features and operational characteristics of the buildings. An important distinction is made between extrinsic values of energy consumption (district features) and intrinsic values (building characteristics, management and operation). The results indicate that 90\% of the mean value of extrinsic gas consumption across districts in London is between ï¿½??42 and 87 kWh/m2. Buildings located in districts that have positive values of extrinsic gas consumption consume more gas over and above their expected intrinsic value of gas consumption. The novel features of this study are in the quantification and propagation of district-scale features to their influence on buildings, and the reduction in uncertainties around the mean value of gas consumed by different building types. }

The internal loads are inextricably linked to occupant behaviour, both directly through the contribution of occupant heat output to thermal energy balance and indirectly via the interactions between occupants, appliances and building services. While occupancy itself is difficult to measure directly, most buildings possess a wealth of data in the form of monitored electricity consumption in varying degrees of resolution. These data, particularly plug loads, may be used to inform the model of occupant-related internal loads. Different approaches to parameterisation of plug loads have been investigated, with the purpose of exploring the conditions that might lead to preference of one approach over another. The models have been tested through a case study and simulation results have been compared against a range of response variables. Conclusions have been drawn as to the most important features of plug load parameterisation for a model to be used for forecasting future demand.",

In the building simulation environment, however, these services are commonly represented through annual transient profiles of internal heat gains, electricity loads, and set point temperatures. The intended capability of DELORES is to stochastically generate such profiles for use in common building energy models, such as TRNSYS and EnergyPlus, and do so whilst presenting users with a straight-forward, easy-to-use interface.

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a surge in the need for uncertainty analysis (UA) for building energy assessment. The rigorous determination of uncertainty in model parameters is a vital but often overlooked part of UA. To undertake this, one has to turn one's attention to a thriving area in engineering statistics that focuses on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for short. This paper applies dedicated methods and theories that are emerging in this area of statistics to the field of building energy models, and specifically to the microclimate variables embedded in them. We argue that knowing the uncertainty in these variables is a vital prerequisite for ensuing UA of whole building behaviour. Indeed, significant discrepancies have been observed between the predicted and measured state variables of building microclimates. This paper uses a set of approaches from the growing UQ arsenal, mostly regression-based methods, to develop statistical models that quantify the uncertainties in the following most significant microclimate variables: local temperature, wind speed, wind pressure and solar irradiation. These are the microclimate variables used by building energy models to define boundary conditions that encapsulate the interaction of the building with the surrounding physical environment. Although our analysis is generically applicable to any of the current energy models, we will base our UQ examples on the energy model used in EnergyPlus.},

	abstract = {Statistical energy modelling \&amp; analysis of building stock is becoming mainstream in the context of city or district scale analysis of energy saving measures. A common aspect in such analyses is that there is generally a set of key explanatory variables ï¿½ or the main inputs ï¿½ that are statistically related to a quantity of interest (end-use energy or CO2). In the context of energy use in buildings, it is not uncommon that the explanatory variables may be correlated. However, there has been little discussion about the correlated variables in building stock research. This paper uses a set of campus buildings as a demonstrative case study to investigate the application of variable importance and meta-model construction in the case of correlated inputs when quantifying energy demand of a building stock. The variable importance analysis can identify key factors that explain energy consumption of a building stock. To this end, it is necessary to apply methods suitable for correlated inputs because the observational data (inputs) of buildings are usually correlated. For constructing statistical energy meta-models, two types of regression models are used: linear and non-parametric models. The results indicate that the linear models perform well compared to the complicated non-parametric models in this case. In addition, a simple transformation of the response, commonly used in linear regression, can improve predictive performance of both the linear and non-parametric models.},

This demand varies in time and also between different buildings, yet, conventional methods are only able to provide mean energy levels per zone and are unable to capture this inhomogeneity, which is important to conserve energy. An additional challenge is that some of the attempts to conserve energy, through for example lowering of ventilation rates, have been shown to exacerbate another problem, which is unacceptable indoor air quality (IAQ). The rise of sensing technology over the past decade has shown potential to address both these issues simultaneously by providing high-resolution tempo-spatial data to systematically analyse the energy demand and its consumption as well as the impacts of measures taken to control energy consumption on IAQ. However, challenges remain in the development of affordable services for data analysis, deployment of large-scale real-time Urban environment sensing network and responding through Building Energy Management Systems. This article presents the fundamental drivers behind the rise of sensing technology for the management of energy and IAQ in urban built environments, highlights major challenges for their large-scale deployment and identifies the research gaps that should be closed by future investigations.},

Bottom-up engineering-based housing stock models can help to serve such a function. These models require calibrating, using micro-level energy measurements at the building level, to improve model accuracy; however, the only publicly available data for the UK housing stock is at the macro-level, at the district, urban, or national scale. This paper outlines a method for using macro-level data to calibrate micro-level models. A hierarchical framework is proposed, utilizing a combination of regression analysis and Bayesian inference. The result is a Bayesian regression method that generates estimates of the average energy use for different dwelling types whilst quantifying uncertainty in both the empirical data and the generated energy estimates. Finally, the Bayesian regression method is validated and the use of the hierarchical Bayesian calibration framework is demonstrated.},

Calibration results can then be assessed by comparing two datasets: the simulated land-use map and the actual land-use map at the same time. A common method for this is the Kappa statistic, which expresses the agreement between two categorical datasets corrected for the expected agreement. This expected agreement is based on a stochastic model of random allocation given the distribution of class sizes. However, when a model starts from an initial land-use map and makes changes to it, that stochastic model does not pose a meaningful reference level. This paper introduces KSimulation, a statistic that is identical in form to the Kappa statistic but instead applies a more appropriate stochastic model of random allocation of class transitions relative to the initial map. The new method is illustrated on a simple example and then the results of the Kappa statistic and KSimulation are compared using the results of a land-use model. It is found that only KSimulation truly tests models in their capacity to explain land-use changes over time, and unlike Kappa it does not inflate results for simulations where little change takes place over time.},

We produce an inventory of UK airport emissions ï¿½ including aircraft landing and takeoff (LTO) operations and airside support equipment ï¿½ with uncertainties quantified. The airports studied account for more than 95\% of UK air passengers in 2005. We estimate that in 2005, UK airports emitted 10.2ï¿½Gg [-23 toï¿½+29\%] of NOx, 0.73ï¿½Gg [-29 toï¿½+32\%] of SO2, 11.7ï¿½Gg [-42 toï¿½+77\%] of CO, 1.8ï¿½Gg [-59 toï¿½+155\%] of HC, 2.4ï¿½Tg [-13 toï¿½+12\%] of CO2, and 0.31ï¿½Gg [-36 toï¿½+45\%] of PM2.5. This translates to 2.5ï¿½Tg [-12 toï¿½+12\%] CO2-eq using Global Warming Potentials for a 100-year time horizon. Uncertainty estimates were based on analysis of data from aircraft emissions measurement campaigns and analyses of aircraft operations.

The First-Order Approximation (FOA3) ï¿½ currently the standard approach used to estimate particulate matter emissions from aircraft ï¿½ is compared to measurements and it is shown that there are discrepancies greater than an order of magnitude for 40\% of cases for both organic carbon and black carbon emissions indices. Modified methods to approximate organic carbon emissions, arising from incomplete combustion and lubrication oil, and black carbon are proposed. These alterations lead to factor 8 and a 44\% increase in the annual emissions estimates of black and organic carbon particulate matter, respectively, leading to a factor 3.4 increase in total PM2.5 emissions compared to the current FOA3 methodology. Ourï¿½estimates of emissions are used in Part II to quantify the air quality and health impacts of UK airports, to assess mitigation options, and to estimate the impacts of a potential London airport expansion.},

In a recent study we classified London's non-domestic buildings based on the service they provide, such as offices, retail premise, and schools, and proposed the creation of one probabilistic representational model per building type. This paper investigates techniques for the development of such models. The representational model is a statistical surrogate of a dynamic energy simulation (ES) model. We first identify the main parameters affecting energy consumption in a particular building sector/type by using sampling-based global sensitivity analysis methods, and then generate statistical surrogate models of the dynamic ES model within the dominant model parameters. Given a sample of actual energy consumption for that sector, we use the surrogate model to infer the distribution of model parameters by inverse analysis. The inferred distributions of input parameters are able to quantify the relative benefits of alternative energy saving measures on an entire building sector with requisite quantification of uncertainties. Secondary school buildings are used for illustrating the application of this probabilistic method.},

This paper presents a scalable, probabilistic methodology that can support large scale investments in energy retrofit of buildings while accounting for uncertainty. The methodology is based on Bayesian calibration of normative energy models. Based on CEN-ISO standards, normative energy models are light-weight, quasi-steady state formulations of heat balance equations, which makes them appropriate for modeling large sets of buildings efficiently. Calibration of these models enables improved representation of the actual buildings and quantification of uncertainties associated with model parameters. In addition, the calibrated models can incorporate additional uncertainties coming from retrofit interventions to generate probabilistic predictions of retrofit performance. Probabilistic outputs can be straightforwardly translated to quantify risks of under-performance associated with retrofit interventions. A case study demonstrates that the proposed methodology with the use of normative models can correctly evaluate energy retrofit options and support risk conscious decision-making by explicitly inspecting risks associated with each retrofit option.},

Geosimulation has been applied to understand such diverse systems as lake ecology, traffic congestion and urban growth. A crucial task common to these applications is to express the agreement between model and reality and hence the confidence one can have in model results. Such evaluation requires a geospatial perspective; it is not sufficient if micro-level interactions are realistic. Importantly, interactions should be such that meso- and macro- level patterns emerging from the model are realistic. In recent years, a host of map comparison methods have been developed, which address different aspects of the agreement between model and reality. This paper places such methods in a framework to systematically assess breadth and width of model performance. The framework expresses agreement at the continuum of spatial scales ranging from local to whole landscape and separately addresses agreement in structure and presence. A common reference level makes different performance metrics mutually comparable and guides the interpretation of results. The framework is applied for the evaluation of a constrained cellular automata model of the Netherlands. The case demonstrates that a performance assessment lacking either a multi-criteria and multi-scale perspective or a reference level would result in an unbalanced account and ultimately false conclusions.},

	abstract = {Spatial interaction models commonly use discrete zones to represent locations. The computational requirements of the models normally arise with the square of the number of zones or worse. For computationally intensive models, such as land useï¿½transport interaction models and activity-based models for city regions, this dependency of zone size is a long-standing problem that has not disappeared even with increasing computation speed in PCsï¿½it still forces modelers to compromise on the spatial resolution and extent of model coverage as well as on the rigor and depth of model-based analysis. This article introduces a new type of discrete zone system, with the objective of reducing the time for estimating and applying spatial interaction models while maintaining their accuracy. The premise of the new system is that the appropriate size of destination zones depends on the distance to their origin zone: at short distances, spatial accuracy is important and destination zones must be small; at longer distances, knowing the precise location becomes less important and zones can be larger. The new method defines a specific zone map for every origin zone; each origin zone becomes the focus of its own map, surrounded by small zones nearby and large zones farther away. We present the theoretical formulation of the new method and test it with a model of commuting in England. The results of the new method are equivalent to those of the conventional model, despite reducing the number of zone pairs by 96\% and the computation time by 70\%.},

Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs) are a technology which can reduce carbon emissions from heating and cooling. GSHP system performance is however highly sensitive to deviation from design values of the actual annual energy extraction/rejection rates from/to the ground. In order to prevent failure and/or performance deterioration of GSHP systems it is possible to incorporate a safety factor in the design of the GSHP by over-sizing the ground heat exchanger (GHE). A methodology to evaluate the financial risk involved in over-sizing the GHE is proposed is this paper. A probability based approach is used to evaluate the economic feasibility of a hypothetical full-size GSHP system as compared to four alternative Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system configurations. The model of the GSHP system is developed in the TRNSYS energy simulation platform and calibrated with data from an actual hybrid GSHP system installed in the Department of Earth Science, University of Oxford, UK. Results of the analysis show that potential savings from a full-size GSHP system largely depend on projected HVAC system efficiencies and gas and electricity prices. Results of the risk analysis also suggest that a full-size GSHP with auxiliary back up is potentially the most economical system configuration.},

abstract = {Increasing complexity of building energy systems has led to a wide range of methods to minimise cost of meeting demand for all types of energy. Metaheuristics and mixed integer linear programmes (MILP) are the two most prevalent optimisation methods in the field, with relative advantages which have not previously been compared under common criteria. The principle objective of this paper is to scrutinise these two optimisation methods when applied to a problem of finding the optimal operational schedule of an energy system serving a hotel. 11 technologies are modelled by both methods, but all exhibit nonlinear characteristics which must be linearised for use in MILP. Comparison of the two models results in variation between objective function below 1%, where piecewise linearised MILP gives the most optimal solution. The time to solution varies by orders of magnitude between models: 0.08s for simple linear MILP, 1.64s for piecewise linear MILP and 274s for metaheuristic. System designers, or controllers, must decide between solution time and realistic representation of technologies when choosing an optimisation method, a compromise which may be balanced by piecewise optimisation. Further, Proposed operation schedules vary slightly between methods, allowing some subjectivity in exact operation schedule, without compromising objective function. Metaheuristics favours qualitative subjectivity, while MILP favours quantitative subjectivity.},

It is revealed that the results from Morris method taking thecommonly used measure for parameter influence can be unstable, while using the median value yieldsrobust results for evaluations with small sample sizes. For the dominant parameters the results from allthree sensitivity analysis methods are in very good agreement. Regarding the evaluation of parameterranking or the differentiation of influential and negligible parameters, the computationally costly quan-titative methods provide the same information for the model in this study as the computational efficientMorris method using the median value. Exploring different methods to investigate higher-order effectsand parameter interactions, reveals that correlation of elementary effects and parameter values in Morrismethod can also provide basic information about parameter interactions.},

We show that using the median value, which is less sensitive to outliers, yields more robust parameter rankings for evaluations with small sample sizes. The performance of the improved Morris method is validated against the variance-based sensitivity analysis. We also investigate correlations between elementary effects and parameter values and find that they can be efficiently used to identify higher-order parameter interactions from a single set of samples used in the Morris method.},

The standard characterisation by energy-use intensity and diversity profile is well established; while quantification of energy-use intensity is achievable using monitored data, there is no standard approach for quantification of diversity profiles. This paper investigates an efficient method for the representation of the shape of the diversity profile using a functional data analysis approach together with electricity consumption data monitored at a spatial resolution that permits correlation of consumption with space use type. The approach has been applied to a case study building and has been shown to give a good agreement with monitored electricity consumption data.

abstract = {Representing nonlinear curves as piecewise elements allows complex systems to be optimised by linear programs. Piecewise linearisation has been recently introduced in the context of distributed energy system optimisation. It is an efficient technique for representing non-linear technology behaviours in linear optimisation models, which are favourable in district energy optimisation models, owing to their speed and ability to handle large numbers of design variables. This paper describes a method of automating the creation of piecewise elements of technology performance curves for minimum fit error. The results show an objective function value improvement at a relatively large penalty in solution time: from 1.6 times to 58 times longer than describing technologies as having a single value for efficiency (SVE). We show that within the context of common technology performance curves, three breakpoints yield sufficiently accurate results and any returns are diminishing beyond that. Even at three breakpoints, it is evident that the placement of breakpoints along a curve significantly influences solution time, in a way for which it is not possible to account in automation. But, large savings can be made by automation by including a constraint to ensure piecewise curves have a strictly increasing/decreasing gradient. This avoids the use of special ordered sets, simplifying model generation and the number of non-continuous variables. SVE models provide a less realistic solution and application of nonlinear consumption curves ex-post shows them to be ultimately more expensive systems than their piecewise counterparts. However, this ex-post analysis applied to SVE models is a good compromise for feasibility level analyses, where whole system cost is key. However, investment decisions and operation schedules are markedly affected by consumption curve representation. Thus, the use of piecewise linearisation is beneficial for detailed design, particularly if automation of breakpoint allocation can help solve the issue of model convergence.},

  abstract = {Increased availability of high resolution metered consumption data shows clear spatio-temporal variability in energy demand, both in terms of magnitude and time. This variability is rarely captured in district energy modelling and optimisation. In this paper, we demonstrate a modelling approach that integrates the stochastic variability of energy demand in energy system optimisation. In our set-up, energy demand is a stochastic function over time, separated into weekdays and weekends in a year. We consider cooling and electricity as end-uses. We implement the district energy optimisation using the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) Scenario optimisation (SO) framework. The stochastic variability of hourly demand is represented by 500 scenarios for 24 typical days in the year. For computational efficiency, we implement a scenario reduction step, resulting in 16 reduced scenarios as representative of the full scenario set. These 16 scenarios are used to formulate an SO model for a group of office buildings in Bangalore, India. The objective in this model is to minimise the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) associated with each scenario, weighted by the probability of that scenario being realised. A scenario can have some demand unmet, but this will incur a financial penalty. To better understand the necessary parametrisation of the model, the penalty for unmet demand is tested by sensitivity analysis.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.12.037},
  abstract = {Current district energy optimisation depends on perfect foresight. However, we rarely know how the future will transpire when undertaking infrastructure planning. A key uncertainty that has yet to be studied in this context is building-level energy demand. Energy demand varies stochastically on a daily basis, owing to activities and weather. Yet, most current district optimisation models consider only the average demand. Studies that incorporate demand uncertainty ignore the temporal autocorrelation of energy demand, or require a detailed engineering model for which there is no validation against real consumption data. In this paper, we propose a new 3-step methodology for handling demand uncertainty in mixed integer linear programming models of district energy systems. The three steps are: scenario generation, scenario reduction, and scenario optimisation. Our proposed framework is data-centric, based on sampling of historic demand data using multidimensional search spaces. 500 scenarios are generated from the historical demand of multiple buildings, requiring historical data to be nonparametrically sampled whilst maintaining interdependence of hourly demand in a day. Using scenario reduction, we are able to select a subset of scenarios that best represent the probability distribution of our large number of initial scenarios. The scenario optimisation step constitutes minimising the cost of technology investment and operation, where all realisations of demand from the reduced scenarios are probabilistically weighted in the objective function. We applied these three steps to a real district development in Cambridge, UK, and an illustrative district in Bangalore, India. Our results show that the technology investment portfolios derived from our 3-step methodology are more robust in meeting large possible variations in demand than any model optimised independently with a single demand scenario. This increased robustness comes at a higher monetary cost of investment. However, the high investment cost is lower than the highest possible cost when each of the initial 500 scenarios is optimised independently. In both our case studies, building level energy systems are always more robust than district level ones, a result which disagrees with many existing studies. The outcomes enable better examination of district energy systems. In addition, our methodology is compiled as an open-source code that can be applied to optimise existing and future energy masterplans of districts.},

Increasing monitoring of electricity consumption generates a real opportunity for gaining an in-depth understanding of the nature of occupant-related internal loads and the connection between activity and demand. The stochastic nature of the demand is well-known but as yet there is no accepted methodology for generating stochastic loads for building energy simulation. This paper presents evidence that it is feasible to generate stochastic models of activity-related electricity demand based on monitored data. Two machine learning approaches are used to develop stochastic models of plug loads; an autoencoder (AE) and a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) model. Using data from two office buildings located in different countries, the transferability of models is explored by training the models on data from one building and using the trained models to predict demand for the other building. The results show that both models predict plug loads satisfactorily, with a good agreement with the mean demand and quantification of the uncertainty.}
