We find that while the programmes significantly reduce conventional poverty, their impact on RDI is twofold: the beneficiaries' integration into networks improves at the expense of deteriorated private relations. These different effects promote measuring poverty and development as multidimensional phenomena and taking into consideration social aspects of development},

	abstract = {The cell walls in plants are made up of just four basic building blocks: cellulose (the main structural fibre of the plant kingdom) hemicellulose, lignin and pectin. Although the microstructure of plant cell walls varies in different types of plants, broadly speaking, cellulose fibres reinforce a matrix of hemicellulose and either pectin or lignin. The cellular structure of plants varies too, from the largely honeycomb-like cells of wood to the closed-cell, liquid-filled foam-like parenchyma cells of apples and potatoes and to composites of these two cellular structures, as in arborescent palm stems. The arrangement of the four basic building blocks in plant cell walls and the variations in cellular structure give rise to a remarkably wide range of mechanical properties: Young's modulus varies from 0.3 MPa in parenchyma to 30 GPa in the densest palm, while the compressive strength varies from 0.3 MPa in parenchyma to over 300 MPa in dense palm. The moduli and compressive strength of plant materials span this entire range. This study reviews the composition and microstructure of the cell wall as well as the cellular structure in three plant materials (wood, parenchyma and arborescent palm stems) to explain the wide range in mechanical properties in plants as well as their remarkable mechanical efficiency.},

We find that high human development can be achieved at moderate energy and carbon levels; increasing energy and carbon past this level does not necessarily contribute to higher living standards. By conducting a novel longitudinal analysis from 1975 to 2005, we observe a previously undetected decoupling of the per capita energy and carbon required for human needs. If resources were equally distributed, current energy and carbon levels would be more than sufficient to satisfy global human needs at high levels of human development. By projecting current trends to 2030, we demonstrate that the global energy consumption and carbon emissions required to satisfy human needs will decrease with time, despite growth in population.},

	abstract = {We present a routing guidance approach that can be used in Automated Highway Systems (AHS). We consider automated highway systems in which intelligent vehicles organised in platoons drive to their destination, controlled by a hierarchical control framework. In this framework there are roadside controllers that provide speed and lane allocation instructions to the platoons. These roadside controllers typically manage single stretches of highways. A collection of highways is then supervised by so-called area controllers that mainly take care of the route guidance instructions for the platoons and that also coordinate the various roadside controllers in their area. In this paper we focus on the optimal route choice control problem for the area controllers. In general, this problem is a non-linear integer optimisation problem with high computational requirements, which makes the problem intractable in practice. Therefore, we first propose a simplified but fast simulation model to describe the flows of platoons in the network. Next, we show that the optimal route choice control problem can be approximated by a mixed-integer linear problem. Later, we describe a new METANET-like model to describe the flow of platoons in the AHS. With a simple case study we illustrate that both approaches result in a balanced trade-off between optimality and computational efficiency.},

	abstract = {As one of the most renewable resources on Earth, bamboo has recently attracted increasing interest for its promising applications in sustainable structural purposes. Its superior mechanical properties arising from the unique functionally-graded (FG) hierarchical structure also make bamboo an excellent candidate for bio-mimicking purposes in advanced material design. However, despite its well-documented, impressive mechanical characteristics, the intriguing asymmetry in flexural behavior of bamboo, alongside its underlying mechanisms, has not yet been fully understood. Here, we used multi-scale mechanical characterizations assisted with advanced environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) to investigate the asymmetric flexural responses of natural bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) strips under different loading configurations, during “elastic bending” and “fracture failure” stages, with their respective deformation mechanisms at microstructural level. Results showed that the gradient distribution of the vascular bundles along the thickness direction is mainly responsible for the exhibited asymmetry, whereas the hierarchical fiber/parenchyma cellular structure plays a critical role in alternating the dominant factors for determining the distinctly different failure mechanisms. A numerical model has been likewise adopted to validate the effective flexural moduli of bamboo strips as a function of their FG parameters, while additional experiments on uniaxial loading of bamboo specimens were performed to assess the tension–compression asymmetry, for further understanding of the microstructure evolution of bamboo’s outer and innermost layers under different bending states. This work could provide insights to help the processing of novel bamboo-based composites and enable the bio-inspired design of advanced structural materials with desired flexural behavior.},

	abstract = {Data centres consist of data halls, or buildings, containing rows of IT server racks, which are used to store, process and transmit information from connected computer networks. There are estimated to be more than 2 million server racks in the UK. Data centres are large energy users, being currently responsible for at least 1.5\% of the electricity demand for the whole of the UK and with increased internet use this is projected to grow by up to 20\% per year up to 2020. Electricity is used both to power the IT servers and for the cooling equipment, such as air conditioning systems, which are used to remove the heat generated by the IT servers. This heat is normally discharged to the ambient air; however, if the heat could be recovered and reused, it would represent a significant heat resource. This paper describes the range of approaches available for the cooling of IT servers and their potential for waste heat recovery and reuse. One waste heat recovery application that has been recently proposed, for example by the UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), is as a heat source for district heating networks. The use of heat pumps to boost the temperature of the waste heat rejected by data centres, in order to meet the heat input requirements for heat networks is explored in this paper, and the potential energy, carbon and cost savings available are presented. The matching of potential data centre waste heat sources to the heat requirements for a number of London districts is also reported.},

This raises some concerns about suitable wood particles needed in the wood-based panels industry in Europe. Concerns are stimulated by the competition between the promotion of wooden products through the European Bioeconomy Strategy and wood as an energy carrier through the Renewable Energy Directive. Cascade use of resources and valorisation of waste are potential strategies to overcome resource scarcity. Under experimental design conditions, WPC made from post-consumer recycled wood and plastic (HDPE) were compared to WPC made from virgin resources. Wood content in the polymer matrix was raised in two steps from 0\% to 30\% and 60\%. Mechanical and physical properties and colour differences were characterized. The feasibility of using cascaded resources for WPC is discussed. Results indicate the technical and economic feasibility of using recycled HDPE from packaging waste for WPC. Based on technical properties, 30\% recycled wood content for WPC is feasible, but economic and political barriers of efficient cascading of biomass need to be overcome.},

Next, we identify different types of organizations that engage in \${\textbackslash}textit\{jugaad\}\$ and elucidate their abilities, or lack thereof, to undertake such innovation. Finally, we incorporate the notion of \${\textbackslash}textit\{jugaad\}\$ within current theorizing on innovation and entrepreneurship and outline an agenda for future research on this topic. Overall, we provide insights on a mode of innovating that is increasingly prevalent in India as well as certain economies around the world and take steps towards integrating this concept into the mainstream theory, practice, and policy discourses around innovation and entrepreneurship.},

	abstract = {Rural areas continue to be home to majority of the population in Africa. The importance of providing modern energy to rural areas cannot, therefore, be overemphasised. Despite numerous efforts by Governments and donors in the region to promote solar photovoltaics (PVs) for rural electrification (almost every country in the region has had a rural electrification PV project), access to modern energy in rural Africa continues to be woefully low. In addition to being unaffordable to the rural masses, solar PV has the limitation that it can only be used for lighting and powering low-voltage appliances. This article reviews emerging trends in the rural energy sector of sub-Saharan Africa, and discusses the limitations of over-reliance on solar PV. It suggests possible options that could have greater impact on rural clean energy development. For the majority of rural households in the region, biomass fuels will continue to be the dominant fuel of choice. Efficient technologies for the use of biomass would, therefore, ensure that scarce biomass resources are effectively utilised, and reduce the negative impacts of biomass use on women and children's health. Solar thermal, windpumps, micro-/pico-hydropower and cleaner fuels such as kerosene and LPG, have not received adequate attention from policy makers. These energy options could significantly improve the performance of rural small- and micro-enterprises. This article argues that rural energy policies that emphasise a broader range of renewables and target income-generating activities are likely to yield greater benefits to the rural poor than the current policies that rely on the solar PV option.},

However, urban areas are only beginning to be represented explicitly in the land-surface schemes of dynamical climate models through modified energy and moisture budgets. This paper summarises recent evidence of urban impacts on climate and vice versa. The technique of statistical downscaling is then introduced through exemplar studies of London's future urban heat island and peak ozone concentrations. Projections of both indices are derived from atmospheric variables supplied by four general circulation models, driven by a medium-high (A2) emissions scenario for the 2050s. The results show further intensification of the nocturnal heat island and higher ozone concentrations that are most pronounced in summer. These changes reflect sensitivity to variations in regional climate alone, so omit other factors such as changes in land use, emissions, climate feedbacks, or synergies between air quality and heat islands. Nonetheless, the downscaled scenarios are consistent with an emerging picture of increasing risks to human health in urban areas unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken.},

Also discussed are those vehicle features which, to a first approximation, can be studied without consideration of the dynamics of the vehicle, including axle and tyre configurations, tyre contact conditions and static load sharing in axle group suspensions. The main emphasis of the paper is on the dynamic tyre forces generated by heavy vehicles: their principal characteristics, their simulation and measurement, the effects of suspension design on the forces and the methods that can be used to estimate their influence on road damage.

Appropriately validated Linear Imaging and Self Scanning Sensor (LISS) III satellite images of Indian Remote sensing Satellite (IRS-P6 series, also known as RESOURCESAT-1), are used to map rice croplands of 1117 villages within nine development blocks of the district. Spatial availability of surplus rice straw residue and, hence, potential power are mapped using a GIS integrated methodology taking cropland and associated data as inputs. Overall, 51.5 thousand tonnes (equivalent to 788 TJ) surplus rice straw is available in Lakhimpur district annually which could generate about 5 MWe at continuous generation with 20\% overall conversion efficiency. The availability, however, varies among the development blocks and villages mainly due to variations in cropped area. Estimated power potential among the development blocks varies between 294 kWe and 927 kWe. Variations of power potential among the villages are also noticed, the highest power potential at village level being 43 kWe. The clusters of the habitation nearby cropland illustrate prospective utility of straw fired electrical power in the locality. The outcomes of the present study, in the form of spatial maps, indicate prospect of decentralized generation of electricity based on locally available surplus rice straw. Straw fired decentralized generation of electricity could be an attractive option considering (i) huge gaps between the demand and availability of electricity and (ii) the remoteness of the locality.},

This socio-technical research highlights the dynamics between technology and society and how they are mutually influencing and shaping each other. These dynamics create gradual changes in the socio-technical system of technical devises, people, practices, knowledge and other elements, requiring adjustments also by the implementing actors. A range of technical and non-technical factors at various levels are found to be relevant for the implementation, operation, sustenance and further development of the solar power supply systems. The research points to important factors that should be taken into account and considered when planning similar activities.

	abstract = {A city-scale renewable energy network for heating and cooling can significantly contribute to reduction of fossil fuel utilization and meeting the renewable energy targets. Ground source heat pump (GSHP) system is a technology that transfers heat stored over long periods to/from the ground to heat/cool the buildings. In particular, a vertical closed loop GSHP is a viable choice in densely populated urban areas. In this study, an ArcGIS-based simulation model has been developed to examine how many vertical closed loop GSHPs can be feasibly installed at city scale without overusing the geothermal energy underground. City of Westminster, in London, is used as a case study to identify and map areas where GSHPs can serve as a viable option for heating and/or cooling. A parametric study has been conducted to investigate the influence of how space heating and cooling demand is quantified on the potential utility of GSHP systems. The influence of COP variation during operation is also examined. The operational variation of COP influences the electricity consumption of the GSHP systems. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis including the capital cost, C/D ratio distribution, energy demand, and financial risk is highly recommended for district-level planning of GSHP systems.},

	abstract = {AbstractConsidering global trends such as climate change and resource scarcity, a major challenge of future cities will be to reduce urban footprints. Moreover, cities have to become or remain livable for their inhabitants and offer social and economic opportunities. Thus, reconnecting food production and cities offers promising potential. The diffusion of urban farming reflects a rising awareness of how food and farming can shape our cities. A growing number of urban farming projects exist in and on urban buildings, including open rooftop farms, rooftop greenhouses and indoor farming. These projects are characterized by the non-use of land or acreage for farming activities. We use the term ‘Zero-Acreage Farming’ (ZFarming) to represent these farms. The objective of this paper is to: (1) illustrate and systemize present practices of ZFarming and (2) discuss specific novelties of ZFarming in the wider context of urban agriculture. We analyzed 73 ZFarms in cities of North America, Asia, Australia and Europe using a set of criteria, and developed a typology of ZFarming, complemented by in-depth interviews with pioneers in rooftop farming in New York. The results illustrate that ZFarming generates innovative practices that may contribute to a sustainable urban agriculture. Besides growing food, it produces a range of non-food and non-market goods. It involves new opportunities for resource efficiency, new farming technologies, specific implementation processes and networks, new patterns of food supply and new urban spaces.},

We estimate a set of multivariate regression models, using cross-section dataset of 488 bus drivers operating over 92 days in 2010, in 87 routes with different bus typologies, of a transit company operating in the Lisbon’s Metropolitan Area (LMA), Rodoviária de Lisboa, S.A.

Our results confirm the existence of influential variables regarding energy efficiency and these are mainly: vehicle type, commercial speed, road grades over 5\% and bus routes; and to a lesser extent driving events such as: sudden longitudinal decelerations and excessive engine rotation. The methodology proved to be useful for the bus operator as a decision-support tool for efficiency optimization purpose at the company level.},

	abstract = {Land use change for bioenergy feedstocks is likely to intensify as energy demand rises simultaneously with increased pressure to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Initial assessments of the impact of adopting bioenergy crops as a significant energy source have largely focused on the potential for bioenergy agroecosystems to provide global-scale climate regulating ecosystem services via biogeochemical processes. Such as those processes associated with carbon uptake, conversion, and storage that have the potential to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). However, the expansion of bioenergy crops can also lead to direct biophysical impacts on climate through water regulating services. Perturbations of processes influencing terrestrial energy fluxes can result in impacts on climate and water across a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about biophysical feedbacks between vegetation, water, and climate that would be affected by bioenergy-related land use change. The physical mechanisms involved in biophysical feedbacks are detailed, and interactions at leaf, field, regional, and global spatial scales are described. Locally, impacts on climate of biophysical changes associated with land use change for bioenergy crops can meet or exceed the biogeochemical changes in climate associated with rising GHG's, but these impacts have received far less attention. Realization of the importance of ecosystems in providing services that extend beyond biogeochemical GHG regulation and harvestable yields has led to significant debate regarding the viability of various feedstocks in many locations. The lack of data, and in some cases gaps in knowledge associated with biophysical and biochemical influences on land–atmosphere interactions, can lead to premature policy decisions.},

On the basis of the agricultural and forest produce of this region, the residues generated after processing are estimated for all the countries. The paper also addresses the use of gasification technology – an efficient thermo-chemical process for distributed power generation – either to replace fossil fuel in an existing diesel engine based power generation system or to generate electricity using a gas engine. This approach enables the implementation of electrification programs in the rural sector and gives access to grid quality power. This study estimates power generation potential at about 5000 MW and 10,000 MW by using 30\% of residues generated during agro processing and 10\% of forest residues from the wood processing industry, respectively. A power generation potential of 15000 MW could generate 100 terawatt-hours (TWh), about 15\% of current generation in SSA. The paper also summarizes some of the experience in using the biomass gasification technology for power generation in Africa and India. The paper also highlights the techno economics and key barriers to promotion of biomass energy in sub-Saharan Africa.},

Yet little is understood about the forces behind urban farming or its impact at the household level. Intrahousehold dynamics and gender relations, as well as declining wages and economic informalization are all important to an understanding of urban farming. Access to land is a major constraint, and only a small fraction of urban farmers own their land. For those with access to land, urban farming is associated with higher levels of household food security and child nutrition.

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the dissemination process and use of Solar Home Systems (SHS) in Sri Lanka. The introduction of this technology in remote rural areas of Sri Lanka is combined with the provision of microloans which allow potential users to finance these systems. An explorative empirical survey was conducted in Monaragala, one of the poorest districts of Sri Lanka, analysing the contribution of the implementation of SHS towards poverty reduction. The survey is based on qualitative interviews with 40 users of SHS and expert interviews with the main implementation actors in this field (e.g. the financing institution, developing engineers). The majority of the interviewed users highlighted improved quality of life due to the availability of electricity, but also expressed discontent with the limited capacity of SHS and frequent functionality issues. Depending on their economic situations, different types of households vary in their capabilities to react to these limitations. Especially poor SHS users do not have the financial resources to replace inoperable equipment during the period of loan repayment. Access to electricity via SHS has not necessarily led to better productivity in agriculture or other productive sectors. The study concludes that robust technologies, adequate maintenance and financing strategies as well as embedding provision of energy supply in broader regional development strategies are necessary if implementation of SHS is going to effectively contribute towards poverty reduction in remote rural areas.},

Radical change or technological discontinuity is defined as the establishment of a new sociotechnical regime. Sociotechnical regimes carry and store rules for how to produce, use and regulate specific technologies. They perform the task of genes and define the boundary between technological species. It is proposed that radical change is generated by four different evolutionary mechanisms and patterns: natural selection, punctuated equilibrium, market niche selection, and technological niche selection. In each pattern, a different type of niche is implicated in the change process. The difference between niches results from differentiating between two dimensions: (1) whether niches are internal or external to the prevailing sociotechnical regime; (2) whether rules for design and use of a specific technology are stable or unstable within the niche.},

This paper presents the results of a computational study on the energy consumption and related CO2 emissions for heating and cooling of an office building within the Urban Heat Island of London, currently and in the future. The study developed twenty weather files in an East-West axis through London; the weather files were constructed according to future climate change scenario for 2050 suitable for the UK which have been modified to represent specific locations within the London UHI based on measurements and predictions from a program developed for this purpose (LSSAT). The study simulated an office with typical construction, heat gains and operational patterns with an advanced thermal simulation program (IESVE). The predictions confirm that heating load decreases, cooling load and overheating hours increase as the office location moves from rural to urban sites and from present to future years. It is shown that internal heat gains are an important factor affecting energy performance and that night cooling using natural ventilation will have a beneficial effect at rural and city locations. As overheating will increase in the future, more buildings will use cooling; it is shown that this might lead to a five-fold increase of CO2 emission for city centre offices in London in 2050. The paper presents detailed results of the typical office placed on the East-West axis of the city, arguing the necessity to consider using weather files based on climate projections and urban heat island for the design of current buildings to safeguard their efficiency in the future.},

Two long water channels had to be built to supply water to the palaces and vegetable gardens of the Alhambra and its surroundings. Where it was necessary, ingenious elevation systems were implemented to break the altitude limitations. Muḥammad I built the Royal Water Channel in 1238 to supply the palatine city and the irrigated areas of the almunia of the Generalife. Later on, in the second half of the fourteenth century, the Acequia de los Arquillos was opened by Muḥammad V to supply another series of outdoor palaces with vegetable gardens that could not be serviced by the Acequia Real. The decline through Nasrid rule in the fifteenth century prevented the survival of these latest almunias that were the most costly to maintain.

	abstract = {According to the latest Global Tracking Framework (2015), 18\% of the global and 57\% of the African population live without access to electricity services—a key impediment towards social and economic growth. Accelerating access to electricity requires, inter alia, strategies and programmes that effectively address and account for the geographical, infrastructural and socioeconomic characteristics of a country or region. This paper focuses on considering these characteristics by developing a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based methodology to inform electrification planning and strategies. The methodology is applied to Nigeria in order to identify the optimal mix of electrification options, ranging from grid extensions to mini-grid and off-grid solutions. The case study illustrates how this optimal mix is influenced by a range of parameters—including population density, existing and planned transmission networks and power plants, economic activities, tariffs for grid-based electricity, technology costs for mini-grid and off-grid systems and fuel costs for consumers. For a certain level of energy access, on-grid connections would be optimal for the majority of the new connections in Nigeria; grid extension constitutes the lowest cost option for approximately 86\% of the newly electrified population in this modelling effort with 2030 as the time horizon. However, there are some remote areas with low population densities where a mini-grid or a stand-alone solution are the most economic options; deploying some combination of solar, wind, hydro and diesel technologies depending on the locational resource availability.},

	abstract = {Emerging markets offer tremendous growth opportunities for firms. While established multinational firms typically focus on premium segments in emerging markets, they often fail to leverage additional growth opportunities in so-called good enough or low-income segments in emerging markets. Customers in these low-income markets have substantially different requirements and are very price sensitive. Theoretical and case-based research suggests that innovating for these low-income segments in emerging markets differs significantly from innovating for premium or traditional Western markets. We argue that tapping successfully into low-income segments in emerging markets requires the development of new products that meet the low price expectations while at the same time offering also value to customers in these segments. We refer to these new products as affordable value innovations. We analyze the antecedents of affordable value innovation for emerging markets. We draw on institutional theory to derive three potentially relevant antecedents of affordable value innovation for emerging markets. These are bricolage, local embeddedness, and standardization. We test our hypotheses using multiple informant data from 47 multinational corporations involving 103 innovation projects that target low-income customers in emerging markets. Our empirical analysis shows that all three antecedents have significant effects on the level of affordable value innovation: while bricolage and local embeddedness are positively related to the level of affordable value innovation, standardization has a negative impact. We also examine the relationship between the level of affordable value innovation and performance. We find evidence for our basic assumption that a firm's capability to develop and launch affordable value innovations is key to success in emerging markets. It indicates that a firm's investments in affordable value innovations for emerging markets pay off financially. Finally, a cross-regional comparison of our data shows that the key findings on antecedents of affordable value innovation and its impact on performance do not vary across various emerging markets. Overall, our findings offer important implications for research on and the practice of innovation for low-income segments in emerging markets.},

This article quantifies causal effects of road network capacity expansions on aggregate urban traffic volume and density in U.S. cities using a mixed model propensity score (PS) estimator. The motivation for this approach is that we seek to estimate a dose-response relationship between capacity and volume but suspect confounding from both observed and unobserved characteristics. Analytical results and simulations show that a longitudinal mixed model PS approach can be used to adjust effectively for time-invariant unobserved confounding via random effects (RE). Our empirical results indicate that network capacity expansions can cause substantial increases in aggregate urban traffic volumes such that even major capacity increases can actually lead to little or no reduction in network traffic densities. This result has important implications for optimal urban transportation strategies. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

The representation can be used to predict traffic's evolution over time and space, including transient phenomena such as the building, propagation, and dissipation of queues. The easy-to-solve difference equations used to predict traffic's evolution are shown to be the discrete analog of the differential equations arising from a special case of the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. The proposed method automatically generates appropriate changes in density at locations where the hydrodynamic theory would call for a shockwave; i.e., a jump in density such as those typically seen at the end of every queue. The complex side calculations required by classical methods to keep track of shockwaves are thus eliminated. The paper also shows how the equations can mimic the real-life development of stop-and-go traffic within moving queues.},

Previous studies have illustrated substantial reliability benefits of dispatchable distributed energy resources (DER). However, more analysis and new evaluation methodologies are needed for microgrids dominated by limited and stochastic distributed generation (SDG). The present paper introduces an evaluation methodology for islanded microgrids that realistically represents stochastic resources and explicitly examines the influence of supply-to-load correlation on reliability. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to model component failure and repair, while historical data is used for the stochastic resource. SDG output is allocated to loads based on a prioritized order that accounts for the dynamic reconfiguration of the microgrid in the case of a local fault. Voluntary load curtailment and its impact on reliability are also examined. Simulation results reveal that the priority order of a given load section on an islanded microgrid with limited SDG determines its dominant cause of interruption and has a major influence on reliability.},

	abstract = {Green roofs can be classified as intensive and extensive roofs based on their purpose and characteristics. Green roofs are built with different layers and variable thicknesses depending on the roof type and/or weather conditions. Basic layers, from bottom to top, of green roof systems usually consists of a root barrier, drainage, filter, growing medium, and vegetation layer. There are many environmental and operational benefits of vegetated roofs. New technology enabled the use of low density polyethylene and polypropylene (polymers) materials with reduced weight on green roofs. This paper evaluates the environmental benefits of green roofs by comparing emissions of NO2, SO2, O3 and PM10 in green roof material manufacturing process, such as polymers, with the green roof’s pollution removal capacity. The analysis demonstrated that green roofs are sustainable products in long-term basis. In general, air pollution due to the polymer production process can be balanced by green roofs in 13–32 years. However, the manufacturing process of low density polyethylene and polypropylene has many other negative impacts to the environment than air pollution. It was evident that the current green roof materials needed to be replaced by more environmentally friendly and sustainable products.},

This paper deals with general overview of BIM and its benefits as well as specifics of implementing information modelling in the tunnelling business utilizing BIM (Building Information Modelling) technology developed for buildings as well as similar technology developed for the mining industry. Although BIM was initially recognised as a 3D digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility, the benefits of using it are much wider than anticipated by its definition.

Results indicated that young bamboo has a higher strength, elastic stiffness, and fracture toughness than its older counterpart does. In addition, the hardness of bamboo is both load dependent and time dependent as a result of an expanding interfacial damage zone and indentation creep, respectively. In addition to fiber debonding, crack deflection and crack-bridging are the major energy dissipative processes for imparting a high toughness in bamboo.},

	abstract = {The design and construction of a hydrokinetic turbine intended for off-grid remote communities in Sarawak, Malaysia, are demonstrated and explained in this paper. By estimating the power required by a single remote home, knowing the average velocity of a nearby river, and making reasonable assumptions for the efficiency of the turbine, transmission and generator, the turbine diameter and hence blade length can be calculated using standard formulae. Having determined the length of the blades the blade profiles (twist angles and chord lengths) at ten selected sections along the blade can be calculated. The profile coordinates x, y are then plotted and printed in Excel or they can be exported to Solidworks CAD software. The printed profiles are traced on thin pieces of softwood and are cut and shaped manually using common tools to form section templates. These templates are then arranged in order, given the right twist angles, glued and screwed to form a whole blade template. This template is copied using a simple, easily constructed copy router in order to produce three identical wooden blades which will be used in a turbine system. Since the construction of optimum blades has been simplified and demonstrated, turbine blades can be made in remote villages near to where the turbine will be used and maintained. This gives village people a sense of ownership and reduces cost, avoiding importation of ready-made systems where an unfavorable currency exchange rate has made almost everything too expensive for underprivileged people in developing countries.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this research is to determine the characteristics of households installing solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Bangladesh, a developing country, where rural electrification, improvement of rural livelihoods and sustainable development constitute the primary development agenda. This article attempts to determine quantitatively the factors that affect the two main purchase decisions of PV systems, or solar home systems (SHS). The first purchase decision is the adoption of SHS, the determinants of which are examined using a binary probit model that analyzes the characteristics of households with SHS and without SHS. The second purchase decision is the size of the SHS, the determinants of which are assessed using an ordered probit model for the households using SHS. The results indicate that household income, ownership of rechargeable batteries, kerosene consumption, and the number of mobile phones are the key determinants of the adoption of SHS. While household income is identified as one of the key determinants, this study shows that household income alone cannot explain adequately the variation in households' SHS adoption. Moreover, the analysis of the choice of SHS capacity also finds that the size of SHS chosen by households is related significantly to the level of kerosene consumption, the number of children, the concern about indoor pollution, and the need for electric lighting in addition to household income.

A key message from the findings of this research is that nonincome factors play a significant role in the dissemination of SHS in rural Bangladesh as the level of kerosene consumption is found to have a strong influence on the decision to start using SHS. This research argues that household income is not a sufficient basis for determining the latent demand for SHS in rural Bangladesh.},

	abstract = {This paper uses the method of kinematic waves, developed in part I, but may be read independently. A functional relationship between flow and concentration for traffic on crowded arterial roads has been postulated for some time, and has experimental backing (section 2). From this a theory of the propagation of changes in traffic distribution along these roads may be deduced (section section 2, 3). The theory is applied (section 4) to the problem of estimating how a 'hump', or region of increased concentration, will move along a crowded main road. It is suggested that it will move slightly slower than the mean vehicle speed, and that vehicles passing through it will have to reduce speed rather suddenly (at a 'shock wave') on entering it, but can increase speed again only very gradually as they leave it. The hump gradually spreads out along the road, and the time scale of this process is estimated. The behaviour of such a hump on entering a bottleneck, which is too narrow to admit the increased flow, is studied (section 5), and methods are obtained for estimating the extent and duration of the resulting hold-up. The theory is applicable principally to traffic behaviour over a long stretch of road, but the paper concludes (section 6) with a discussion of its relevance to problems of flow near junctions, including a discussion of the starting flow at a controlled junction. In the introductory sections 1 and 2, we have included some elementary material on the quantitative study of traffic flow for the benefit of scientific readers unfamiliar with the subject.},

The main purpose of this study was to propose an economical and optimized design for electricity generation using hybrid energy source PV/Biomass for an agricultural farm and a residential community centered in a small village of district Layyah in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The electric load data was collected for the irrigation and residential needs. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) was used to design and perform techno-economic analysis to meet the load requirements using PV/biomass hybrid configuration. The solar irradiance data and the available biomass potential on the farm was used in the HOMER software to perform the analysis. Total net present cost (NPC) and cost of electricity (COE) were obtained as a solution by the HOMER analysis and then these results were refined further by performing sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity parameter such as biomass potential, biomass price, solar irradiance and variations in loads were used in the sensitivity analysis. This analysis compares the performance of the system and shows that system is techno-economically viable based on the net present cost and cost of energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper reviews use of organic resources in rural Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), impacts on household energy, and interactions with provision of food and water. Wood, charcoal and dung supply over 70\% of household energy in SSA, but with improvements in energy technologies, crop-residues and human excreta could also contribute. Improving cookstoves is not enough to make woodfuel use sustainable, reducing deforestation due to woodfuel demand by only 41–50\%. Further reductions of 21\% are achieved by using crop-residues and 23\% by anaerobic digestion of cattle manure. Taken together, these measures could reduce deforestation due to woodfuel demand by 70–100\%. Burning crop-residues loses a large proportion of nitrogen needed for crop production, which could be partially counteracted by applying biochar from pyrolysis cookstoves to improve retention of soil nitrogen. Better nutrient recycling would be achieved by composting, but this precludes energy provision. Both energy and efficient nutrient recycling are provided by anaerobic digestion, but carbon sequestration is reduced compared to composting or pyrolysis. Nevertheless, a wider range of waste materials may be recycled in the closed digester system, so pyrolysis of dry crop-residues together with anaerobic digestion of wet wastes is likely to provide the best solution for both food and energy. However, anaerobic digestion may demand more water than pyrolysis and, if soil carbon is reduced, may also increase the need for irrigation. Therefore, in water limited areas, biogas digesters should only be installed if integrated with water harvesting systems. Governments can encourage adoption of sustainable technologies by providing subsidies to cover fixed costs, facilitating credit and complementary infrastructure investments, and improving standardisation and quality control in cookstove and digester markets. Implementation work should involve communities and households, giving women a role in decision-making to ensure community investment in water access.},

	abstract = {Three porous materials (growstone, expanded clay and activated carbon) were evaluated as hydroponic growing media and for their individual ability to remove the indoor volatile organic compound formaldehyde under three conditions: growing medium alone, dry medium in a pot, and wet medium in a pot. The total percent-reduction of formaldehyde by each growing media was evaluated over a 10-h period. In all cases, activated carbon achieved the highest removal under the three conditions studied with average percent reductions measured at about 98\%. Four common interior plants: Hedera helix (English ivy), Chrysanthemum morifolium (pot mum), Dieffenbachia compacta (dump cane) and Epipremnum aureum (golden pathos) growing in growstone were then tested for their ability to remove formaldehyde. The removal capacity of the aerial plant parts (AP), the root zone (RZ) and the entire plant (EP) growing in growstone were determined by exposing the relevant parts to gaseous formaldehyde (∼2000 μg m −3) in a closed chamber over a 24-h period. The removal efficiency between species and plant parts were compared by determining the time interval required to decrease about 2/3 of the total formaldehyde concentration reduction, T 2/3. The T 2/3 measured were 23, 30, 34 and 56 min for EP of C. morifolium, E. aureum, D. compacta and H. helix, respectively. The formaldehyde removal by the root zone was found to be more rapid than the removal by the aerial plant parts. Highlights ► The four plant species demonstrated similar abilities to remove formaldehyde. ► The T 2/3 determined for each species was significantly different. ► Activated carbon showed highest formaldehyde removal under all conditions studied. ► All plant species showed faster uptake of formaldehyde under dark cycle conditions.},

	abstract = {The effects of carbon dioxide concentration (CO2) in the range 300–1100 μmol mol−1 on leaf conductance (g) and rate of crop transpiration (E) of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) were investigated in spring 1990. In two greenhouse compartments (154 m2) that were simultaneously exposed to different CO2 levels, leaf conductance of the upper leaves was measured with a steady state diffusion porometer and crop transpiration rates were measured with three weighing lysimeters per greenhouse compartment. Multiple regression equations, describing the effects of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), vapour pressure deficit (VPD)-leaf-air, CO2 and optionally leaf temperature on g, were fitted to the measured data. The fitted regression curves demonstrated that 100 μmol mol−1 increase in CO2 reduced g by about 3\%, at any level of CO2, VPD and PAR, if VPD and PAR would remain constant. Measured rates of crop transpiration were highly correlated to radiation and were in reasonable accordance with the Penman-Monteith combination equation. With this equation it was estimated that a 10\% decrease in g would reduce E by 1.5–3\% at high levels of g (high radiation) and by 4–7\% at low g (dark weather), at least if VPD would remain constant. In a greenhouse-crop system, however, owing to thermal and hydrologic feedbacks, an increase in CO2 leads to a considerable increase in VPD-leaf-air. This enforces the effect of CO2 on g and counteracts the effect of CO2 on E, because the driving force for transpiration is enhanced. Thus, in general the apparent response of g to changes in CO2 is far greater than the mentioned percentage, whereas the apparent response of E is relatively small.},

Hence, knowledge communication to the local solar companies who carry out the sizing and installations, and to the users who have to handle their systems according to the usage instructions, is a crucial factor for success. For effective knowledge communication, new information should always match the recipients' existing beliefs and misbeliefs. Our study provides a first insight into the prevalence of beliefs and misbeliefs among key stakeholders in Uganda regarding basic technical aspects of solar home systems. Moreover, we analyze the ability of stakeholders, who are responsible for knowledge transfer, to accurately predict the users' beliefs. A total of 139 representatives from five groups of key stakeholders responded to ten knowledge items. Users were asked to give their personal opinion about each item. In addition to their own opinion, the other stakeholders estimated the users' opinions. The first result of our survey reveals an early knowledge drop in the chain of information transfer from the manufacturers via supervising organizations in Uganda, down to the local solar companies and the users. As a consequence, solar companies and users do not possess the required knowledge to run the systems sustainably. The second result demonstrates that those stakeholders, who possess the technical knowledge and the means to design instructions for users, are unable to see the users' perspective due to great psychological distance, thus limiting effective knowledge transfer.},

	abstract = {In rural areas of developing countries, electrification projects with photovoltaic systems were conceived as pilot projects with the implementation of a limited number of systems. After considerable financial support from international donors, photovoltaic systems were often quickly abandoned few years after their installation. Using micro-credit institutions in the energy sector or implementing small utilities with a fee-for-service model is now considered as two desirable options to create a dynamic self-sustained market for solar home systems.

South Africa launched in 1999 an ambitious off-grid solar electrification programme with fee-for-service concessions. Operating as small-scale utilities, fee-for-service concessions have facilitated the implementation on a large scale of solar home systems and solved the issue of high up-front cost and of long-term maintenance.

This paper focuses on operational and design issues linked to the implementation of fee-for-service concessions. Even in a challenging institutional context, some South African operators seem almost able to reach their break-even point. The case of one concessionaire is detailed and serves as a basis for a discussion on the benefits and difficulties linked to the fee-for-service model and on the potential for replication.},

	abstract = {Abstract
The European project OFFICAIR aimed to broaden the existing knowledge regarding indoor air quality (IAQ) in modern office buildings, i.e., recently built or refurbished buildings. Thirty-seven office buildings participated in the summer campaign (2012), and thirty-five participated in the winter campaign (2012 − 2013). Four rooms were investigated per building. The target pollutants were twelve volatile organic compounds, seven aldehydes, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter \&lt; 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Compared to other studies in office buildings, the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene concentrations were lower in OFFICAIR buildings, while the α-pinene and d-limonene concentrations were higher, and the aldehyde, nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 concentrations were of the same order of magnitude. When comparing summer and winter, significantly higher concentrations were measured in summer for formaldehyde and ozone, and in winter for benzene, α-pinene, d-limonene, and nitrogen dioxide. The terpene and 2-ethylhexanol concentrations showed heterogeneity within buildings regardless of the season. Considering the average of the summer and winter concentrations, the acetaldehyde and hexanal concentrations tended to increase by 4–5\% on average with every floor level increase, and the nitrogen dioxide concentration tended to decrease by 3\% on average with every floor level increase. A preliminary evaluation of IAQ in terms of potential irritative and respiratory health effects was performed. The 5-day median and maximum indoor air concentrations of formaldehyde and ozone did not exceed their respective WHO air quality guidelines, and those of acrolein, α-pinene, and d-limonene were lower than their estimated thresholds for irritative and respiratory effects. PM2.5 indoor concentrations were higher than the 24-h and annual WHO ambient air quality guidelines.},

However, many un-electrified communities would prefer access to electricity via the national grid rather than off-grid technologies. Electricity planning based on cost efficiency alone could therefore be undermined by political pressure from discontented communities that are assigned off-grid technologies. Using a case study of un-electrified communities in Ghana, we develop an electricity planning algorithm based on hierarchical lexicographic programming and consider specifications where the priorities are adjusted to give weight to (1) cost efficiency and (2) political economy considerations so that communities with larger populations (and therefore votes) are given priority in terms of grid electrification. The results emphasise the need to incorporate the political economy considerations in the national planning of universal electrification, showing significant regional differences in terms of where grid extensions ought to be placed. Incorporating a political economy perspective in national planning also suggests that the most important policy trade-offs shift from considering the grid versus off-grid balance to focussing more on the effectiveness of grid investment in providing universal access.},

It was found that, with a moderate increase in indoor light intensity, this species removed significant amounts of CO from test chambers, removing up to 61\% ± 2.2 of 1000 ppmv over a 40 min period. It was also found that the hydroculture growth medium facilitated increased CO removal over potting mix. The VOC removing potential of hydroculture plants was also demonstrated. Whilst the rate of VOC (benzene) removal was slightly lower for hydroculture-grown plants than those grown in potting mix, both removed 25 ppmv from the test chambers within 7 days. The effect of benzene on the community level physiological profiles of rhizospheric bacteria was also assessed. There was less variability in the carbon substrate utilisation profile of the bacterial community from the rhizosphere of hydroculture plants compared to potting mix, however the species present encompassed at least those involved with VOC removal. Overall, we propose that plants grown in hydroculture can simultaneously deplete CO and VOCs, and thus may have potential for improving indoor air quality.},

	abstract = {Predictive control is the strategy that has the greatest reported benefits when it is implemented in a building energy management system. Predictive control requires low-order models to assess different scenarios and determine which strategy should be implemented to achieve a good compromise between comfort, energy consumption and energy cost. Usually, a deterministic approach is used to create low-order models to estimate the indoor CO2 concentration using the differential equation of the tracer-gas mass balance. However, the use of stochastic differential equations based on the tracer-gas mass balance is not common. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential of creating predictive models for a specific room using for the first time a stochastic grey-box modelling approach to estimate future CO2 concentrations. First of all, a set of stochastic differential equations are defined. Then, the model parameters are estimated using a maximum likelihood method. Different models are defined, and tested using a set of statistical methods. The approach used combines physical knowledge and information embedded in the monitored data to identify a suitable parametrization for a simple model that is more accurate than commonly used deterministic approaches. As a consequence, predictive control can be easily implemented in energy management systems.},

	abstract = {The future of humanity depends on whether or not we have a vision to guide our transition toward sustainability, on scales ranging from local landscapes to the planet as a whole. Sustainability science is at the core of this vision, and landscapes and regions represent a pivotal scale domain. The main objectives of this paper are: (1) to elucidate key definitions and concepts of sustainability, including the Brundtland definition, the triple bottom line, weak and strong sustainability, resilience, human well-being, and ecosystem services; (2) to examine key definitions and concepts of landscape sustainability, including those derived from general concepts and those developed for specific landscapes; and (3) to propose a framework for developing a science of landscape sustainability. Landscape sustainability is defined as the capacity of a landscape to consistently provide long-term, landscape-specific ecosystem services essential for maintaining and improving human well-being. Fundamentally, well-being is a journey, not a destination. Landscape sustainability science is a place-based, use-inspired science of understanding and improving the dynamic relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being in changing landscapes under uncertainties arising from internal feedbacks and external disturbances. While landscape sustainability science emphasizes place-based research on landscape and regional scales, significant between landscape interactions and hierarchical linkages to both finer and broader scales (or externalities) must not be ignored. To advance landscape sustainability science, spatially explicit methods are essential, especially experimental approaches that take advantage of designed landscapes and multi-scaled simulation models that couple the dynamics of landscape services (ecosystem services provided by multiple landscape elements in combination as emergent properties) and human well-being.},

We then develop lessons based on the comparison of four case studies. These include three regional developing country power pools – the Southern African Power pool (SAPP), West African Power pool (WAPP) and the Central American Power Market (MER). We contrast these with Northern Europe's Nord Pool. These cases highlight both the potential and difficulty of having cross-jurisdictional power pools.
In the light of the theory and evidence we present, we draw key lessons in the areas of: preconditions for trading; necessary institutional arrangements; practicalities of timetabling; reasons to be hopeful about future prospects.},

	abstract = {Introduction of new technologies is necessarily a social and cultural transformation that implies adaptation to a new context, co-created by the interaction between those intervened and interveners. Sustainable technologies should be aimed to preserve basic functions of socio-ecological systems while limiting evolution of unsustainable practices, as it is the case of non-conventional renewable energy sources.

In this research we propose a methodology of intervention for the introduction of smart microgrid system in a rural community. The introduction of new energy technologies in a rural setting is a challenge, since it generates changes in patters of energy use that affect the demand of the system. Smart microgrid systems have the advantage of being more resilient than conventional approaches to renewable energy, as they can adapt to changes in the demand and through time.

The proposed methodology is based on the concept of a community as a socio-ecological system approach affected by a technological intervention, aimed to move towards a stage of more sustainable use of resources. The method is divided in three stages, each one focused on enhancing elements of the socio-ecological systems and integration among stakeholders: trust, diversity, boundaries of the system, territoriality, adaptability and reflexivity.

This methodology is validated in a case study on smart microgrids development in a rural community in the north of Chile. The application of this methodology highlights the importance of learning processes among stakeholders, specially the development of reflexivity within developers.

Adoption and adaptation to new technologies depends on the characteristics of each community, but it can be enhanced when participation shapes the evolution of the technological intervention, opening up to a diversity of expectations associated to the complexity of the system.},

This paper presents an exploratory research on fire behavior of Guadua angustifolia kunth (a.k.) bamboo. Fire reaction was assessed through critical heat flux for ignition and flame spread while fire resistance through charring rate and strength variation with temperature. Fire reaction fall within standard limits used for structural woods, while fire resistance results are higher than that of plywood. Based on these preliminary results, Guadua a.k. would be adequate as structural and indoor finishing building material.},

After explaining its methods of data collection – namely research interviews, field research, and a literature review – the article explores the specific components of the NPDP as well as its progress to date. The most successful part of the project focused on Microhydro Village Electrification and distributed more than 250 units to 50,000 households in less than ten years. The article then delves into the delivered benefits of the NPDP before identifying a series of technical, economic, political, and social challenges. It concludes by highlighting how community involvement and mobilization, institutional diversity, reliance on simple technologies matched in proper scale to energy end-uses, maintenance and after sales service, flexibility, and restructuring can enhance the effectiveness of energy development programs.},

A cluster analysis was applied to create 20 classes that were reported on a map of Africa. These classes were geographically extended, thus creating a solar radiation climate map, comprising 20 climates. Known features and other atlases, global or local, were used in this mapping. This map and its companion tables permit to perform elementary energy calculations. Further improvements are discussed.},

If the leading-vehicle acceleration remains within the limits, all vehicles in the platoon remain within the limits when the relative-velocity feedback coefficient is equal to the headway time constant [ k = 1 / h ] . Furthermore, if the sensitivity α \&gt; 1 / h , no collisions occur. String stability for small perturbations is assumed and the initial condition is taken as the equilibrium state. Other values of k and α that give stability with no collisions are found from simulations. For vehicles with non-negligible mechanical response, simulations indicate that the acceleration-feedback-control gain might have to be dynamically adjusted to obtain optimal performance as the response time changes with engine speed. Stability is demonstrated for some perturbations that cause initial acceleration or deceleration greater than the limits, yet do not cause collisions.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate whether keeping indoor thermal conditions and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels within the current guideline values can provide a healthy and comfortable school environment. The study was organised as a longitudinal investigation over an academic year using a cohort of 376 students aged 9 to 11 (response rate: 87\%) attending 15 classrooms in five London primary schools. The prevalence of asthmatic symptoms and asthma attacks was significantly higher among children attending urban schools (10.2\%) than suburban schools (1.5\%), and was significantly related to exposure to higher nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations (odds ratio: 1.11, 95\% confidence interval: 1.00–1.19). Self-reported dermal, mucosal, respiratory and general symptoms were 18.5\%, 60.7\%, 28.2\% and 43.6\% respectively in the heating season, and decreased in the non-heating season. Infiltration rates were negatively associated with prevalence and incidence of all sick building syndrome symptoms. Exposure to traffic-related pollutants, such NO2, ozone (O3) and tetrachloroethylene (T4CE), associated with mucosal symptoms, also increased dissatisfaction with indoor air quality (IAQ) and, therefore, perceived IAQ might be a first indication of exposure. Among targeted microbial counts, only Trichoderma viride remained significant predictors of satisfaction with IAQ even at low concentrations. The study provides evidence that simultaneous provision for limiting indoor CO2 levels and thermal conditions below current guidelines (e.g. below 1000 ppm and 26℃ or 22℃ depending on season) may improve perceived IAQ. This paper stresses the need to go beyond current regulations to investigate concentrations of specific pollutants to ensure a healthy school environment, and closes with a section on the practical implications on the UK policy and the building design industry.Practical application: The findings highlight the role and responsibility of stakeholders, from regulators to designers and school authorities, to account for the external environment and take the steps needed to ensure that schools provide a healthy indoor environment for their students. The recommendations focus on the need to decrease outdoor pollution levels in the school vicinity, thus improving health of the students and reducing the prevalence of respiratory illness. Building designers and engineers shall adopt an integrated approach for the simultaneous provision of adequate thermal conditions and IAQ in classrooms.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based approach to modelling individual driver behaviour under the influence of real-time traffic information. The driver behaviour models developed in this study are based on a behavioural survey of drivers which was conducted on a congested commuting corridor in Brisbane, Australia. Commuters’ responses to travel information were analysed and a number of discrete choice models were developed to determine the factors influencing drivers’ behaviour and their propensity to change route and adjust travel patterns. Based on the results obtained from the behavioural survey, the agent behaviour parameters which define driver characteristics, knowledge and preferences were identified and their values determined. A case study implementing a simple agent-based route choice decision model within a microscopic traffic simulation tool is also presented. Driver-vehicle units (DVUs) were modelled as autonomous software components that can each be assigned a set of goals to achieve and a database of knowledge comprising certain beliefs, intentions and preferences concerning the driving task. Each DVU provided route choice decision-making capabilities, based on perception of its environment, that were similar to the described intentions of the driver it represented. The case study clearly demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and the potential to develop more complex driver behavioural dynamics based on the belief–desire–intention agent architecture.},

It includes rooftop gardens, rooftop greenhouses, indoor farms, and other building-related forms (defined as “ZFarming”). This study uses the framework of sustainability to understand the role of ZFarming in future urban food production and to review the major benefits and limitations. The results are based on an analysis of 96 documents published in accessible international resources. The analysis shows that ZFarming has multiple functions and produces a range of non-food and non-market goods that may have positive impacts on the urban setting. It promises environmental benefits resulting from the saving and recycling of resources and reduced food miles. Social advantages include improving community food security, the provision of educational facilities, linking consumers to food production, and serving as a design inspiration. In economic terms it provides potential public benefits and commodity outputs. However, managing ZFarming faces several challenges. For some applications, the required technologies are known but have not been used or combined in that way before; others will need entirely new materials or cultivation techniques. Further critical aspects are the problem of high investment costs, exclusionary effects, and a lack of acceptance. In conclusion, ZFarming is seen as an outside-the-box solution which has some potential in generating win–win scenarios in cities. Nevertheless, ZFarming practices are not in and of themselves sustainable and need to be managed properly.},

	abstract = {Buildings account for about 40\% of the global energy consumption and contribute over 30\% of the CO2 emissions. A large proportion of this energy is used for thermal comfort in buildings. This paper reviews thermal comfort research work and discusses the implications for building energy efficiency. Predicted mean vote works well in air-conditioned spaces but not naturally ventilated buildings, whereas adaptive models tend to have a broader comfort temperature ranges. Higher indoor temperatures in summertime conditions would lead to less prevalence of cooling systems as well as less cooling requirements. Raising summer set point temperature has good energy saving potential, in that it can be applied to both new and existing buildings. Further research and development work conducive to a better understanding of thermal comfort and energy conservation in buildings have been identified and discussed. These include (i) social-economic and cultural studies in general and post-occupancy evaluation of the built environment and the corresponding energy use in particular, and (ii) consideration of future climate scenarios in the analysis of co- and tri-generation schemes for HVAC applications, fuel mix and the associated energy planning/distribution systems in response to the expected changes in heating and cooling requirements due to climate change.},

	abstract = {Poplar trees sustain close to the predicted increase in leaf photosynthesis when grown under long-term elevated CO2 concentration ([CO2]). To investigate the mechanisms underlying this response, carbohydrate accumulation and protein expression were determined over four seasons of growth. No increase in the levels of soluble carbohydrates was observed in the young expanding or mature sun leaves of the three poplar genotypes during this period. However, substantial increases in starch levels were observed in the mature leaves of all three poplar genotypes grown in elevated [CO2]. Despite the very high starch levels, no changes in the expression of photosynthetic Calvin cycle proteins, or in the starch biosynthetic enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), were observed. This suggested that no long-term photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 occurred in these plants. Our data indicate that poplar trees are able to ‘escape’ from long-term, acclimatory down-regulation of photosynthesis through a high capacity for starch synthesis and carbon export. These findings show that these poplar genotypes are well suited to the elevated [CO2] conditions forecast for the middle of this century and may be particularly suited for planting for the long-term carbon sequestration into wood.},

First, it reformulates and differentiates the typology through the lens of endogenous enactment, identifying the main patterns for actors, formal institutions, and technologies. Second, it suggests that transitions may shift between pathways, depending on struggles over technology deployment and institutions. Both contributions are demonstrated with a comparative analysis of unfolding low-carbon electricity transitions in Germany and the UK between 1990–2014. The analysis shows that Germany is on a substitution pathway, enacted by new entrants deploying small-scale renewable electricity technologies (RETs), while the UK is on a transformation pathway, enacted by incumbent actors deploying large-scale RETs. Further analysis shows that the German transition has recently shifted from a ‘stretch-and-transform’ substitution pathway to a ‘fit-and-conform’ pathway, because of a fightback from utilities and altered institutions. It also shows that the UK transition moved from moderate to substantial incumbent reorientation, as government policies became stronger. Recent policy changes, however, substantially downscaled UK renewables support, which is likely to shift the transition back to weaker reorientation.},

The method was established based on spatial weighted degree and local improved structural hole (LISH) models by using node degrees fused with traffic characteristics. The node degree was redefined, and the traffic characteristics of a road network were integrated into the LISH model. The proposed method for calculating key nodes was validated using the backbone road network of Shaanxi Province. Results confirm the feasibility and rationality of the model. The improved LISH model is also more effective than existing models in identifying key nodes in the road network. This study provides a technical basis for determining key nodes of large-scale complex road networks by using CIS.},

	abstract = {The paper reports the operational experience from a 100 kWe gasification power plant connected to the grid in Karnataka. Biomass Energy for Rural India (BERI) is a program that implemented gasification based power generation with an installed capacity of 0.88 MWe distributed over three locations to meet the electrical energy needs in the district of Tumkur. The operation of one 100 kWe power plant was found unsatisfactory and not meeting the designed performance. The Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, the technology developer, took the initiative to ensure the system operation, capacity building and prove the designed performance.

The power plant connected to the grid consists of the IISc gasification system which includes reactor, cooling, cleaning system, fuel drier and water treatment system to meet the producer gas quality for an engine. The producer gas is used as a fuel in Cummins India Limited, GTA 855 G model, turbo charged engine and the power output is connected to the grid.

The system has operated for over 1000 continuous hours, with only about 70 h of grid outages. The total biomass consumption for 1035 h of operation was 111 t at an average of 107 kg/h. Total energy generated was 80.6 MWh reducing over 100 t of CO2 emissions. The overall specific fuel consumption was about 1.36 kg/kWh, amounting to an overall efficiency from biomass to electricity of about 18\%. The present operations indicate that a maintenance schedule for the plant can be at the end of 1000 h. The results for another 1000 h of operation by the local team are also presented.},

	abstract = {This study developed a dynamic traffic control formulation designated as dynamic intersection signal control optimization (DISCO). Traffic in DISCO is modeled after the cell-transmission model (CTM), which is a convergent numerical approximation to the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. It considers the entire fundamental diagram and captures traffic phenomena such as shockwaves and queue dynamics. As a dynamic approach, the formulation derives dynamic timing plans for time-variant traffic patterns. We solved DISCO based on a genetic algorithm (GA) approach and applied it to a traffic black spot in Hong Kong that is notorious for severe congestion. For performance comparisons, we also applied TRANSYT to the same scenarios. The Results showed that DISCO outperformed TRANSYT for all the scenarios tested especially in congested traffic. For the congested scenarios, DISCO could reduce delay by as much as 33\% when compared with TRANSYT. Even for the uncongested scenarios, DISCO’s delays could be smaller by as much as 23\%.},

The proposed algorithm solves the measurement update equations with iterative methods adaptively to reduce linearization errors. With the scalability advantage being kept, the consistency and accuracy of SEIF is improved. Simulations and practical experiments were carried out with both a land car benchmark and an autonomous underwater vehicle. Comparisons between iterative SEIF (ISEIF), standard EKF and SEIF are presented. All of the results convincingly show that ISEIF yields more consistent and accurate estimates compared to SEIF and preserves the scalability advantage over EKF, as well.},

The long lifecycles of the building stock, the impacts of climate change and the requirements for low carbon development underline the need for long-term thinking from the early design stages. ‘Future-proofing’ is an emerging research agenda with currently no widely accepted definition amongst scholars and building professionals. In this paper, it refers to design processes that accommodate explicitly full lifecycle perspectives and energy trends and drivers by at least 2050, when selecting energy efficient measures and low carbon technologies. A knowledge map is introduced, which explores the key axes (or attributes) for achieving a ‘future-proofed’ energy design; namely, coverage of sustainability issues, lifecycle thinking, and accommodating risks and uncertainties that affect the energy consumption. It is concluded that further research is needed so that established building energy assessment methods are refined to better incorporate future-proofing. The study follows an interdisciplinary approach and is targeted at design teams with aspirations to achieve resilient and flexible low-energy buildings over the long-term.},

The mathematical model features a detailed description of the internal combustion engine based on a mean value approach, and simplified sub-models for the throttle valve, the intake and exhaust manifolds, and the external circuit. The validated zero-dimensional dynamic mathematical model of the system is implemented in gPROMS®�x00AE;{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}textregistered \}, and used for simulation and optimization studies. The objective of the design optimization is to estimate the optimum displacement volume of the internal combustion engine that minimizes the operational costs while satisfying the electrical and heating demand of a residential 10-house district. The simulation results show that the mathematical model can accurately predict the behavior of the actual system while the design optimization will later be the basis for advanced control studies.},

	abstract = {Over the next 25 to 30 years, nearly all of the growth in energy demand, fossil fuel use, associated local pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions is forecast to come from the developing world. This paper argues that the world's poor and near-poor will play a major role in driving medium-run growth in energy consumption. As the world economy expands and poor households' incomes rise, they are likely to get connected to the electricity grid, gain access to good roads, and purchase energy-using assets like appliances and vehicles for the first time. We argue that the current forecasts for energy demand in the developing world may be understated because they do not accurately capture growth in demand along the extensive margin, as low-income households buy their first durable appliances and vehicles. Within a country, the adoption of energy-using assets typically follows an S-shaped pattern: among the very poor, we see little increase in the number of households owning refrigerators, vehicles, air conditioners, and other assets as incomes go up; above a first threshold income level, we see rapid increases of ownership with income; and above a second threshold, increases in ownership level off. A large share of the world's population has yet to go through the first transition, suggesting there is likely to be a large increase in the demand for energy in the coming years.},

There was no obligation for those in rural communities, the majority of the population, to adopt Islam, and they remained barely aware of the presence of Islam in the Peninsula. Islam was confined to the cities, and made little impact elsewhere. Subsequently, Arabicization increased, irrespective of religion. The Mozarabs of Toledo were Arabicized and were regarded as suspect co-religionaries, notably by Archbishop Rodrigo in the thirteenth century; they worked together with Muslims to facilitate the transmission of learning that later led to the Renaissance in Europe. Religious affiliation among Christians, Muslims, and Jews did not impinge on the translating process. In the sixteenth century, at the grass-roots level, moriscos had a different way of life from the viejos cristianos, but co-existed, and posed no threat. It was the prevailing political situation that made the continuation of the moriscos in the Peninsula impossible.},

In the phase 1 experiments the measured dynamic tyre forces generated by fourteen articulated vehicle combinations (three tractors and five trailers) are used to confirm previous theoretical predictions of spatial repeatability. In the phase 2 experiments the dynamic tyre forces generated by over 1500 heavy goods vehicles travelling on a British trunk road are used to estimate the degree of repeatability exhibited by a typical highway fleet.
Spatial repeatability is assessed using the ‘spatial repeatability index’ (SRI), and a method is developed to correct the SRI for sensor noise. Approximately half the vehicles tested were found to contribute to a spatially repeatable pattern of road loading.},

The results show that the cost-optimized option for majority of the un-electrified communities will be grid connection, accounting for more 85\% of the total un-electrified communities in each region. The total cost of electrification (which includes initial and recurring) at 100\% penetration rate totalled US\$ 696 million with a breakdown as follows: US\$ 592 million for grid electrification, US\$ 47 million for off-grid electrification and US\$ 58 million for mini-grid compatible communities. Sensitivity analysis shows that model scenarios with higher electricity demand and higher household penetration rate generally recommend a larger percentage of communities for grid electrification, rather than off-grid or diesel mini-grid. One important aspect of this modelling approach is that it predicts costs for different electricity generation technologies for each of the communities involved and thus gives the planner the freedom to explore the most cost-effective technology based on existing conditions in the community and price trend of electrification inputs during the planning period.},

Six themes are identified: scope, weighting, subjectivity, rigor, adaptation, and life cycle analysis. Planners have begun to develop and implement green building policies and programs, although there is much room for expansion of the role of planning in green building issues. The article concludes by outlining a broad research agenda that can help move the discussion of the role of planning in green building issues forward. Planning needs to take a more assertive role in green buildings to add more comprehensiveness to the issue.},

While most individuals understand that outdoor air quality is important to their health status, many are unaware of the detrimental effects indoor air pollution can potentially have on them. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates both outdoor and indoor air quality. According to the EPA, indoor levels of pollutants may be up to 100 times higher than outdoor pollutant levels and have been ranked among the top 5 environmental risks to the public. There has been a strong correlation between air quality and health, which is why it is crucial to obtain a complete environmental exposure history from a patient. This article focuses on the effects indoor air quality has on the respiratory system. Specifically, this article will address secondhand smoke, radon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, house cleaning agents, indoor mold, animal dander, and dust mites. These are common agents that may lead to hazardous exposures among individuals living in the United States. It is important for health care providers to be educated on the potential risks of indoor air pollution and the effects it may have on patient outcomes. Health problems resulting from poor indoor air quality are not easily recognized and may affect a patient?s health years after the onset of exposure.},

Many studies have been conducted over the past 10 years to consider the potential building energy benefits of green roofs and shown that they can offer benefits in winter heating reduction as well as summer cooling.
This paper reviews the current literature and highlights the situations in which the greatest building energy savings can be made. Older buildings with poor existing insulation are deemed to benefit most from a green roof as current building regulations require such high levels of insulation that green roofs are seen to hardly affect annual building energy consumption.
As over half of the existing UK building stock was built before any roof insulation was required, it is older buildings that will benefit most from green roofs. The case for retrofitting existing buildings is therefore reviewed and it is found there is strong potential for green roof retrofit in the UK.},

This function is concerned with the cost of serving the entire field by all agents, where the so called operation cost of different agents are not necessarily the same. The problem is investigated for the case where agents have different types of dynamics. Using a multiplicatively-weighted Voronoi diagram, the field is partitioned to smaller regions (one for each agent). A distributed coverage control law is then provided that guarantees the convergence of agents to the optimal configuration with respect to the above-mentioned cost function. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulations and experiments on a testbed with two types of unmanned vehicles (aerial and ground).},

In this study, the thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of bamboo and sugarcane bagasse at five different heating rates of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 °C min−1 are performed. The intersection method (IM) and deviation method (DM) are employed to approach the ignition temperatures of the two biomass species, while IM and the conversion method (CM) are adopted to analyze their burnout temperatures. In IM and CM, both the ignition and burnout temperatures increase with increasing heating rate, as a consequence of the pronounced thermal lag in biomass particles at high heating rates. The measured ignition temperatures based on DM are lower than those based on IM, and there is no correlation between the temperature and heating rate. The determined burnout temperatures from IM are close to those obtained from CM, while the difference in the burnout temperatures of the two biomass samples is small. The ignition temperatures of the two biomass species measured from IM are between 250 and 300 °C, and their burnout temperatures are close to 500 °C. As a whole, IM is recommended for determining the ignition temperature of biomass, while CM is a feasible and simple route to approach the burnout temperature. The heating rates in TGA between 20 and 30 °C min−1 are suggested because of their accurate and time-saving operations.},

	abstract = {Heat recovery plays an important role in energy saving in the supply chain of steel products. Almost all high temperature outputs in the steel industry have their thermal energy exchanged to preheat inputs to the process. Despite the widespread development of heat recovery technologies within process stages (process heat recovery), larger savings may be obtained by using a wider integrated network of heat exchange across various processes along the supply chain (integrated heat recovery). Previous pinch analyses have been applied to optimise integrated heat recovery systems in steel plants, although a comparison between standard process heat recovery and integrated heat recovery has not yet been explored. In this paper, the potential for additional energy savings achieved by using integrated heat recovery is estimated for a typical integrated steel plant, using pinch analysis. Overall, process heat recovery saves approximately 1.8 GJ per tonne of hot rolled steel (GJ/t hrs), integrated heat recovery with conventional heat exchange could save 2.5 GJ/t hrs, and an alternative heat exchange that also recovers energy from hot steel could save 3.0 GJ/t hrs. In developing these networks, general heat recovery strategies are identified that may be applied more widely to all primary steel production to enhance heat recovery. Limited additional savings may be obtained from the integration of the steel supply chain with other industries.},

	abstract = {Buildings, their surroundings and related enterprises produce more CO2, generate more pollution, consume more energy, and waste more natural resources than any other human enterprise or industry. Moreover, considerable parts of these environmental impacts are the results of the lodging industry [1].

Hotels are designed as multifunctional buildings to provide different comfort levels and services to guests. It is often desirous to pay for exclusive amenities. Resorts are often developed in untouched and very sensitive ecosystems with little or no consideration taken for the natural or cultural surroundings. Most strategies applied in design and many of the services offered by lodging establishments require the consumption of substantial quantities of energy, water and non-durable products.

The efficiency of the resource use starting from the building design to the end-users in hotel facilities is typically low, and the resulting environmental impacts are greater than those caused by other types of commercial buildings of similar size [2]. Decisions taken during the architectural building design play AS important A role in reducing these environmental impacts as DOES THE management of the building.

With a goal of enhancing the overall energy performance of hotel buildings, this paper represents a research-design project, located in İzmir-Turkey, based on the effect of passive solar design techniques for designing the building envelopes to develop and demonstrate high performance.},

	abstract = {This article explores basic concepts in energy strategy by outlining and contrasting two energy paths that the U.S. might follow over the next 590 years, as of October 1976. The first path resembles present federal policy and is essentially an extrapolation of the recent past. The second path combines a prompt and serious commitment to efficient use of energy, rapid development of renewable energy sources matched in scale and in energy quality to end-use needs and special transitional fossil-fuel technologies. These choices may seem abstract, but they are sharp, imminent and practical. Delay in energy conservation lets wasteful use run on so far that the logistical problems of catching up become insuperable. Delay in widely deploying diverse soft technologies pushes them so far into the future that there is no longer a credible fossil-fuel bridge to them, they must be well under way before the worst part of the oil-and-gas decline. Delay in building the fossil-fuel bridge makes it too tenuous, what the sophisticated coal technologies can give the people in the U.S., in particular, will no longer mesh with their pattern of transitional needs as oil and gas dwindle. Yet these kinds of delay are exactly what people can expect if they continue to devote so much money, time, skill, fuel and political will to the bard technologies that are so demanding of them. Enterprises like nuclear power are not only unnecessary but a positive encumbrance for they prevent people, through logistical competition and cultural incompatibility, from pursuing the tasks of a soft path at a high enough priority to make them work together properly. A hard path can make the attainment of a soft path prohibitively difficult, both by starving its components into garbled and incoherent fragments and by changing social structures and values in a way that makes the innovations of a soft path more painful to envisage and to achieve.},

	abstract = {South Asia accounts for 42\% of the global population without access to electricity. Such a situation continues to exist despite several initiatives and policies to support electrification efforts by the respective country governments. The challenges to enhance electricity access are manifold including technical, financial, institutional and governance barriers. This paper makes a modest attempt, based on extensive literature review, to highlight the rural electrification situation at the regional and country level in South Asia. The paper also does a comparative analysis to exploit cross learning potential and suggest specific boosters that could serve as input for policy evaluation, review and improvements to assist future electrification efforts in the region. We focussed on renewable energy based mini-grids and stand-alone systems and also covered conventional grid extension. The paper raised some pertinent issues and attempted to find solutions to these issues. The household connection needs to be improved considerably through a targeted approach and innovative micro-lending model. At the same time the electricity supply also needs to be enhanced, such as through distributed power projects utilizing locally available renewable resources, to ensure that connected households continue to receive electricity and that supply constraints do not inhibit extending electrification to new areas. Developing a regulatory mechanism to extend the tariff fixation for mini-grid projects and providing cross-subsidies to ensure long term sustainability of such projects are highlighted. Finally, economic linkages, access to credit and institutional arrangements also need to be organized appropriately, especially for off-grid RE to facilitate successful outcomes.},

Drawing from extensive in-field interviews of stakeholders in Sarawak who are affected by the soon-to-be-completed 2400 megawatt (MW) Bakun Hydroelectric Project, this article presents documentary evidence that these “hard path” mega energy projects are economically, socially and ecologically sub-optimal. The study suggests that more rigorous development of “soft path” small-scale, decentralized renewable energy systems more effectively support development and electrification aspirations for the region. The paper concludes with an analysis which invalidates the rationale for supporting mega projects yet recognizes that powerful advocates pose significant threats to a transition from hard to soft energy paths. It puts forth a concluding recommendation that pressure to scale down these mega projects and bolster decentralized, small-scale initiatives represents the most feasible approach to optimizing rural electrification in Sarawak. Overall, this case study provides both a detailed analysis of the inadequacies of mega energy projects in supporting economic development in less affluent regions and insight into how to strategically facilitate ideological change from hard (mega projects) to soft (decentralized energy systems) energy paths.},

These models assume that energy is an intermediate product of some combination of human labour and capital. These models also assume that the supply of energy is driven by economic demand. We assume the contrary, i.e. that useful energy is a primary input, derived (mostly) from natural capital. This failure to capture the impact of primary resources (as useful energy) on economic growth leads to inappropriate formulation of economic growth theories. To understand that impact better we need explicit evidence of marginal products of capital, labour and useful energy or useful work. As applied to the explanation of the past half century of economic growth of the EU-15 countries, the new results demonstrate the use of non-parametric relationships between capital, labour and useful energy to explain economic growth. They also indicate that marginal products of capital, labour and useful energy are variable – the marginal product depends on the levels of capital stock, labour input and useful energy flows. The proposed semi-parametric production function suggests country-specific policy implications for the EU (and other countries).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}{\textless}title{\textgreater}{\textless}x{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/x{\textgreater}{\textless}/title{\textgreater}{\textless}sec{\textgreater}{\textless}title{\textgreater}Highlights{\textless}/title{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}list{\textgreater}{\textless}list-item{\textgreater}{\textless}label{\textgreater}•{\textless}/label{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}One-size-fits-all macroeconomic policy is a travesty of reality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/list-item{\textgreater}{\textless}list-item{\textgreater}{\textless}label{\textgreater}•{\textless}/label{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The need to coordinate capital–labour–energy policies is shown{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/list-item{\textgreater}{\textless}list-item{\textgreater}{\textless}label{\textgreater}•{\textless}/label{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The importance of capital, labour and useful energy is country specific.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/list-item{\textgreater}{\textless}/list{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

However, rural electrification offered little by way of market incentives for profit-seeking private companies and was often neglected. As a consequence, delivery models for rural electrification need to change. This paper will review the experiences of various rural electrification delivery models that have been established in developing countries, including concessionary models, dealership approaches and the strengthening of small and medium-sized energy businesses. It will use examples from the USA, Bangladesh and Nepal, together with a detailed case study of a Nepali rural electric cooperative, to explore the role that local cooperatives can play in extending electricity access. It is shown that although there is no magic bullet solution to deliver rural electrification, if offered appropriate financial and institutional support, socially orientated cooperative businesses can be a willing, efficient and effective means of extending and managing rural electricity services. It is expected that this paper will be of particular value to policy-makers, donors, project planners and implementers currently working in the field of rural electrification.},

This paper surveys the empirical literature on electricity sector reforms and draws some conclusions with a view to the future. Overall, the reforms have tended to improve the technical efficiency of the sector. The macroeconomic benefits of reforms are less clear and remain difficult to identify. Also, the gains from the reforms have often not trickled down to consumers because of institutional and regulatory weaknesses. In order to achieve lasting benefits, reforms need to adopt measures that align their pursuit of economic efficiency with those of equity and provision of access. Reforms can deliver more economic benefits and alleviate poverty when the poor have access to electricity. New technologies and institutional capacity building can help improve the performance of reforms.},

	abstract = {Several short term studies have found evidence that plants may improve occupant thermal comfort, yet this phenomena has not yet been rigorously evaluated. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a quasi-experiment that evaluated the effect of indoor plants on the thermal comfort of 67 office workers within an office building in De Lier, The Netherlands, for four months, one month each season, in 2013. The participants' thermal comfort was recorded twice a day, while the globe temperature, relative humidity, and light levels of the workspaces were monitored. The indoor operative temperature of the test rooms were varied between typical and more extreme indoor operative temperature ranges throughout the quasi-experiment in a controlled manner. The presence of a substantial quantity of plants in the work environment was found to have a significant effect on the thermal comfort of the participants. For example, the occupants of the two rooms in which the presence of plants was alternated, were both, on average, approximately 12.0\% more thermally comfortable when plants were present in the room. In addition, they were approximately 1.79 and 1.95 times more likely to be thermally comfortable when plants were present in the room, respectively. These results indicate that the incorporation of a substantial quantity of plants in office buildings can lead to reduced building energy consumption and carbon emission rates, by allowing the temperature setpoint to be raised in the summer and lowered in the winter.},

In this study a comparison was made of rates of removal of benzene, as model VOC, by seven potted-plant species/varieties. In static test-chambers, high air-borne doses of benzene were removed within 24 h, once the response had been stimulated (‘induced’) by an initial dose. Removal rates per pot ranged from 12-27 ppm d−1 (40 to 88 mg m−3 d−1) (2.5 to 5 times the Australian maximum allowable occupational level). Rates were maintained in light or dark, and rose about linearly with increased dose. Rate comparisons were also made on other plant parameters. Micro-organisms of the potting mix rhizosphere were shown to be the main agents of removal. These studies are the first demonstration of soil microbial VOC degradation from the gaseous phase. With some species the plant also made a measurable contribution to removal rates. The results are consistent with known, mutually supportive plant/soil-micro-organism interactions, and developments in microbially-based ‘biofilter reactors’ for cleaning VOC-contaminated air.

	abstract = {Support of urban agriculture can be used as a route to reducing urban poverty across Sub-Saharan Africa. However policy makers require more precise information on how it contributes to alleviating food insecurity and poverty problems. This study in Malawi's two main cities (Lilongwe and Blantyre) revealed two predominant 'types' of urban farmers: (i) low-income, less educated, often female-headed households, who use urban agriculture as an insurance against income losses and who can employ skilled workers to support their livestock activities; and (ii) middle- and high-income, often male-headed households, that undertake urban agriculture for personal consumption and hire significant numbers of unskilled workers. Within the low-income group, there are some female headed-households who are now receiving significant income from livestock programmes having been provided with initial external support from a non-governmental organisation. Our findings suggest a need for a two-pronged policy approach to try and improve the overall effectiveness of urban agriculture support, namely to (1) target poor women with extension and development project support; and (2) support wealthier farmers to increase the employment opportunities associated with urban agriculture.

However, the deviation between electricity consumption and economic growth in China during the Asian Financial Crisis and Global Economic Crisis sparks intense debates. We attempt to explain the deviation from the perspective of inventory investment adjustment in the business cycle using the SVAR model in this paper. The results show that the effects of inventory investment adjustment shock and electricity consumption structure shock on the deviation are positive but tend to be negative for electricity efficiency shock. The results of historical decomposition of these shocks also show that the inventory investment adjustment shock is the main factor that influences the deviation during the Global Economic Crisis. Economic fluctuation in the short term can not change the economic development pattern and the characteristics of electricity demand. Once the economy returns to stable growth, the deviation between electricity consumption and economic growth will shrink and disappear soon.},

	abstract = {Scenarios imply that there will still be a considerable percentage of people (16\%) without reliable access to electricity, especially in developing and emerging countries, in the year 2030, if ongoing efforts are not intensified. International governance and funding institutions like UNDP and the World Bank consider access to electricity as being fundamental for economic development and poverty reduction. Since the extension of centralized grids is often expensive, different forms of decentralized electricity supply options have gained importance for rural areas and informal settlements during the last 3 decades. Until now, there has been a lack of systematic evaluation of experience with decentralized electricity systems in different cultural and geographic contexts and the transfer of this experience. One reason for this deficiency is that the ‘research community’ for this field is not very clearly defined regarding disciplines and institutions and that there are few institutionalized occasions and forums which enable discussion and systematization of existing knowledge. This article gives a rough overview of the challenges linked to developing and implementing systems of decentralized energy supply under difficult context conditions and the research needs resulting from these challenges. Central means towards success in this domain include embedding the introduction of technical systems in a range of services (e.g. capacity building, maintenance, repair and disposal services, financing schemes), integrating users' needs in their development and implementation, enhancing productive use of electricity by linking energy supply to regional development programs. To be able to deal with the outlined questions, the perspective of decentralized energy supply as socio-technical systems can be helpful. Research desiring to adequately meet the challenges needs to integrate knowledge and perspectives from different disciplines as well as expertise from practitioners in the field in a reflective manner.},

Two new linear state feedback control strategies are described. These regulate aspects of the vehicle response that are believed to be closely related to road damage. Comparisons are made with two established control strategies. The relative performance of the four controllers is examined using a two-axle planar heavy vehicle model, with both active and semi-active suspensions.
Significant improvements are predicted for the three control strategies which account for correlation between the road roughness inputs at the front and rear of the vehicle, both for the active and semi-active suspensions. The state feedback preview control strategy previously developed by Sharp and Wilson [1] is found to give the best all-round performance for a suspension with semi-active suspension dampers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The indoor built environment plays a critical role in our overall well-being because of both the amount of time we spend indoors ({\textasciitilde}90\%) and the ability of buildings to positively or negatively influence our health. The advent of sustainable design or green building strategies reinvigorated questions regarding the specific factors in buildings that lead to optimized conditions for health and productivity. OBJECTIVE: We simulated indoor environmental quality (IEQ) conditions in "Green" and "Conventional" buildings and evaluated the impacts on an objective measure of human performance: higher-order cognitive function. METHODS: Twenty-four participants spent 6 full work days (0900-1700 hours) in an environmentally controlled office space, blinded to test conditions. On different days, they were exposed to IEQ conditions representative of Conventional [high concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)] and Green (low concentrations of VOCs) office buildings in the United States. Additional conditions simulated a Green building with a high outdoor air ventilation rate (labeled Green+) and artificially elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels independent of ventilation. RESULTS: On average, cognitive scores were 61\% higher on the Green building day and 101\% higher on the two Green+ building days than on the Conventional building day (p {\textless} 0.0001). VOCs and CO2 were independently associated with cognitive scores. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive function scores were significantly better under Green+ building conditions than in the Conventional building conditions for all nine functional domains. These findings have wide-ranging implications because this study was designed to reflect conditions that are commonly encountered every day in many indoor environments.},

	abstract = {This review summarizes current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the response of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance to elevated carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]), and examines how downstream processes and environmental constraints modulate these two fundamental responses. The results from free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments were summarized via meta-analysis to quantify the mean responses of stomatal and photosynthetic parameters to elevated [CO2]. Elevation of [CO2] in FACE experiments reduced stomatal conductance by 22\%, yet, this reduction was not associated with a similar change in stomatal density. Elevated [CO2] stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat) in C3 plants grown in FACE by an average of 31\%. However, the magnitude of the increase in Asat varied with functional group and environment. Functional groups with ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-limited photosynthesis at elevated [CO2] had greater potential for increases in Asat than those where photosynthesis became ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RubP)-limited at elevated [CO2]. Both nitrogen supply and sink capacity modulated the response of photosynthesis to elevated [CO2] through their impact on the acclimation of carboxylation capacity. Increased understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which plants respond to elevated [CO2], and the feedback of environmental factors upon them, will improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses to rising [CO2] and increase our potential to adapt crops and managed ecosystems to future atmospheric [CO2].},

All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to approach \$2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly \$4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards, a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs, determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data privacy.},

	abstract = {Recent interest in rural electrification has emphasised the importance of linking its development with productive uses for energy and poverty reduction. This has been viewed as necessary to increase the pace of rural electrification and reduce its concentration on a relatively small number of developing countries. Despite this emphasis, progress in electrifying remote rural areas has been slow. In part this has been attributed to the emphasis on cost recovery and a reliance on the private sector to deliver electricity widely. This paper reviews the literature on the role and relation of infrastructure, particularly infrastructure in rural areas, to economic growth and development. It reviews the focus on poverty reduction by the major international development agencies and examines the arguments for increasing rural incomes. It critically reviews the economic and social issues underlying the development of rural electrification, drawing on the experience with both grid and off-grid applications in developing countries and assesses the impact of electrification on the ability to generate income in rural areas. Conclusions are drawn in relation to the beneficiaries of rural electrification, the constraints that are faced in stimulating economic activity that will contribute to making rural electrification more feasible and affordable and to the importance of complementary services and appropriate institutions to support rural electrification.},

Experiments were conducted inside a 100m2 greenhouse compartment with a shading screen and potted Impatiens plants grown on benches. The greenhouse was equipped with a set of sensors, including a sonic and hot-bulb anemometers, thermocouples, air-humidity/temperature probes and balances.Thermal and water vapour exchanges between the crop and its environment were studied using 2D simulations of the microclimate carried out at a daily time scale within a calculation domain reduced to a parallelepiped, including the plants. The Navier–Stokes equations were solved using the standard k−ε turbulence model. A crop submodel which considers the crop as a porous medium and adds specific source terms for latent and sensible heat transfers was used. Two contrasting days with relatively high and low solar insulations were considered. For both cases, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model showed its ability to simulate the air temperature inside the canopy as well as the vertical distribution of the leaf temperatures throughout the day. It predicted the decrease of leaf temperature from the top to the bottom of the crop with good accuracy. It also provided a good estimation for the trend of transpiration rate throughout the day (coefficients of determination{\textgreater}0.92). Differences between the measured and simulated integrated transpiration rates over 24h-periods remained{\textless}15\%. Consequently, the model could be useful to assess the water requirements of a crop for the purpose of adapting irrigation management to meet plant needs. Highlights► The crop inside a greenhouse interacts with the local climate through coupled mechanisms. ► CFD can be used to assess momentum and energy transfers induced by the canopy. ► CFD makes it possible to predict the evolution of the transpiration rate and leaf temperatures. ► CFD could be a good tool to assess water requirements and adapt an irrigation strategy.},

	issn = {0305750X},
	abstract = {Sub-Saharan African cities in the late 1990s face a daunting set of problems including rapid growth, increasing poverty, deteriorating infrastructure, and inadequate capacity for service provision. Even as a renewed debate is shaping up around issues of urban development, there is little attention given to the question of urban food security. Whereas in the 1970s and 1980s, urban food problems in Africa commanded political attention, the nature of urban food insecurity in the 1990s is such that it has tended to lose political importance. This is largely because in the 1970s, the problem was one of outright food shortages and rapid price changes that affected large portions of the urban population simultaneously. The impact of structural adjustment, continued rapid growth, and an increase in poverty make urban food insecurity in the 1990s primarily a problem of access by the urban poor. Under circumstances where the urban poor spend a very large portion of their total income on food, urban poverty rapidly translates into food insecurity. The lack of formal safety nets, and the shifting of responsibility for coping with food insecurity away from the state towards the individual and household level has tended to atomize and muffle any political response to this new urban food insecurity. This paper briefly reviews urban food insecurity and generates a set of empirical questions for an analysis of food and livelihood security in contemporary urban sub-Saharan Africa, and then examines historical and contemporary evidence from Kampala, Uganda, and Accra, Ghana, to suggest some tentative conclusions.},

The sustainable energy performance indicators that these building assessment models are developed around should be chosen by taking into account the targeted objectives. However, it is very common to find building performance assessment models that do not take into account these considerations and therefore have a limited capability and scope. This leads to inadequate aggregate indicators for the actual assessment of the sustainable performance of the building envelope for a sustainable energy efficient building. The focus of this paper is to investigate the principal sustainable energy performance indicators for modeling the sustainable performance of the residential building envelope and develop an approach for determining the most appropriate sustainable energy performance indicators. In doing that, this paper provides an overview of previous research on sustainable energy performance indicators and discusses conceptual framework for developing sustainable energy performance indicators. In order to identify these indicators that influence the capability of building performance assessment models, a comprehensive survey of construction industry professionals was conducted using questionnaire survey technique while the data was analyzed using correlation analysis techniques.},

Findings suggest that Singapore's public housing estates are suitable for rooftop farming.

Reducing food imports would also decrease Singapore's carbon footprint by 9,052 tonnes of emissions annually.},

The energy consumption and thus the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming are lower than in conventional air-conditioned buildings. However, the ambient temperatures in the UK have risen over the last decade and new climatic data for use in the design of naturally ventilated buildings has been published. Using these data and dynamic thermal modelling, it is shown that passive stack ventilation alone was unlikely to maintain summertime comfort in a proposed University College London building within an urban heat island. The stack ventilation strategy was evolved by the introduction of passive downdraught cooling. This low-energy technique enables cooled air to be distributed throughout the building without mechanical assistance. The underlying principles of the technique were explored using physical models and the anticipated performance predicted using thermal modelling. The architectural integration is illustrated and the control strategy described. The resulting building is believed to be the first large-scale application of the passive downdraught cooling technique; construction began in late 2003. (English)},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the influences on food and farming of an increasingly urbanized world and a declining ratio of food producers to food consumers. Urbanization has been underpinned by the rapid growth in the world economy and in the proportion of gross world product and of workers in industrial and service enterprises. Globally, agriculture has met the demands from this rapidly growing urban population, including food that is more energy-, land-, water- and greenhouse gas emission-intensive. But hundreds of millions of urban dwellers suffer under-nutrition. So the key issues with regard to agriculture and urbanization are whether the growing and changing demands for agricultural products from growing urban populations can be sustained while at the same time underpinning agricultural prosperity and reducing rural and urban poverty. To this are added the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to build resilience in agriculture and urban development to climate change impacts. The paper gives particular attention to low- and middle-income nations since these have more than three-quarters of the world's urban population and most of its largest cities and these include nations where issues of food security are most pressing.},

One of the city affected by the flood was Waverly City, USA which is the Cedar River flow in side of it. One-dimensional/two-dimensional (1D/2D)-Mike Flood hydrodynamic model and 1D-HecRAS hydraulic model were developed for flood analyses in Waverly City. For developing both models, channel geometry was obtained from bathymetric surveys and combined with surface topography obtained from Light Detection and Ranging surveys. Roughness parameters were estimated using land use data from the National Land Cover Dataset and aerial photos. Calibration of roughness on floodplain and channels represents an important issue to determine flood inundation area. Both models were calibrated and validated with 2008 flood. The riverbed was validated with high water levels measured after flood. The floodplain was validated with photos, which was taken during flood from airplane. After calibration and validation, results were compared to choose the best one. Return period flood discharge were calculated and run with best inundation model for determine flood inundation maps. These maps can be used by residents and planners in Waverly City to help make informed decisions about potential risk from floods. (English)},

To overcome the negative effects of traditional energy on human health and the environment and to enhance the livelihood conditions of the poor, a transition towards cleaner and more efficient forms of energy is needed. Understanding household fuel choice and fuel switching behaviour is of vital importance in search for policies to support such a transition process. This paper adds to the existing energy transition literature in two ways. First, we provide a novel conceptual framework to analyze the decision environment underlying energy and fuel choices. Second, we apply this framework in a meta-analysis of existing choice models investigating energy switching and stacking behaviour in urban and rural areas in developing countries. The meta-analysis shows that socio-economic household characteristics appear to receive most attention so far in identifying groups of fuel users, while relatively little information is available on the impact of the external decision context on household energy choices.},

	abstract = {In the context of Sub-Saharan Africa's rapid urbanization, improved insight into urban energy use is increasingly important. Based on the predictions of “energy transition” theory, a regional shift from biomass to “modern” fuels has long been expected to occur in tandem with urban growth. However, trends observed in the region's towns and cities have often not followed such patterns and fuelwood continues to be important in most areas. This paper examines the practical relevance of transition theory using a recent case study, conducted by the authors in Maun, Botswana, and results previously reported in the literature. It finds that, despite the long-term link between socio-economic development and increased modern fuel consumption at the national scale, the notion of “transition” does not accurately reflect ongoing energy-use patterns at lower levels of aggregation. This is chiefly because its model of household fuel switching largely dismisses the importance of active (and strategic) decision making by urban consumers and their responsiveness to structural factors such as relative fuel prices. As the Botswana case illustrates, this weakness can significantly distort expectations and policies around urban fuelwood use.},

Although it seems possible to explain how people move on the basis of these analyses, the question of why they move this way has always seemed problematic because the analysis contains no explicit representations of either motivations or individual cognition. One possible explanation for the method’s predictive power is that some aspects of cognition are implicit in space syntax analysis. This article reviews the contribution made by syntax research to the understanding of environmental cognition. It proposes that cognitive space, defined as that space which supports our understanding of configurations more extensive than our current visual field, is not a metric space, but topological. A hypothetical process for deriving a nonmetric space from the metric visibility graph involving exploratory movement is developed. The resulting space is shown to closely resemble the axial graph.},

	abstract = {Promoting sustainable development requires evaluating the technical and policy options that will facilitate the adoption and use of energy efficient and less polluting cooking stoves and practices. The transition from traditional to modern fuels and devices has been explained by the “energy ladder” model that suggests that with increasing affluence, a progression is expected from traditional biomass fuels to more advanced and less polluting fuels. In this paper we evaluate the energy ladder model utilizing data from a four-year (1992–96) case study of a village in Mexico and from a large-scale survey from four states of Mexico. We show that an alternate “multiple fuel” model of stove and fuel management based on the observed pattern of household accumulation of energy options, rather than the simple progression depicted in the traditional energy ladder scenario, more accurately depicts cooking fuel use patterns in rural households. The “multiple fuel” model integrates four factors demonstrated to be essential in household decision making under conditions of resource scarcity or uncertainty: (a) economics of fuel and stove type and access conditions to fuels, (b) technical characteristics of cookstoves and cooking practices; (c) cultural preferences; and (d) health impacts. This model also allows better estimates of the expected fuelwood demand and indoor air pollution in rural households.},

This paper examines relationships among urbanization, household energy source, and forest cover at the state level in India using available census, survey, and remote sensing analysis from the 1990s and 2000s. Central questions include (1) how rapidly are urban and rural households switching from traditional to modern fuel sources; and (2) what are the consequences of changing household energy sources for fuelwood demand and forest cover. Country-wide, 30 and 78\% of urban and rural households respectively used fuelwood for cooking in 1993. In urban households, the percentage decreased to 22\% by 2005 with a shift towards liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The shift occurred across almost all income classes. In rural areas, the use of LPG increased fourfold but 75\% of households still rely on fuelwood. Despite the decline in percentage households using traditional fuels, fuelwood demand continued to increase from 1993 to 2005 at a national scale due to an increasing total number of households. However, 25\% of states and union territories experienced declines in rural fuelwood demand and over 70\% declines in urban fuelwood demand. Forest cover has remained steady or increased slightly over the time period, reaffirming the conclusion that fuelwood demand may lead to local degradation but not large-scale deforestation. At the state level, increases in percent forest cover between 2000 and 2004 are positively associated with percent of total households that are urban (corresponding to fewer percentage households using wood) but not related to changes in fuelwood demand. Plantations are a primary cause of increases in forest area, where benefits to ecosystem services such as biodiversity and hydrologic function are controversial. Results suggest that households will continue to climb the energy ladder with future urbanization, resulting in substantial development benefits and reduced exposure to indoor air pollution. Implications of reduced fuelwood demand for forest cover are less certain but the limited data suggest that urbanization will promote a transition to increasing forest cover in the Indian context.},

It finds that the primary energy technologies involved with low-income households involve a greater number of fuels and carriers, ranging from dung and fuelwood to liquefied petroleum gas and charcoal, but a fewer number of services. Middle-income households throughout the world tend to rely on electricity and natural gas, followed by coal, liquefied petroleum gas, and kerosene. These homes utilize energy to produce a much broader range services. The upper class or rich have access to the same energy fuels, carriers, and technologies as middle-income homes and families, but consume more energy (and more high luxury items). The study highlights how focusing on energy services reorients the direction of energy policy interventions, that energy services are neither uniform nor innate, and by noting exciting areas of potential research.},

	abstract = {In this paper we argue that formal exchanges with poor consumers in emerging markets are hard to create and maintain, resulting in widespread market failure. More specifically, in emerging markets the institutions required for exchange either function poorly or are entirely absent, making it difficult for sellers to deliver affordable and accessible offerings to poor buyers in a financially sustainable manner. The marketing challenge thus becomes (1) developing a viable business model to facilitate market-based exchanges and (2) shaping the institutions needed to implement this business model. Drawing on institutional theory and extending it with insights from the marketing and business model innovation literatures, we develop a model of exchange in emerging markets. At the heart of our model is the idea that sellers often need to act as institutional entrepreneurs in order to create and deliver value when marketing to the poor in emerging markets. We discuss the implications of our model for future research on marketing, exchange and emerging economies, as well as the implications for managers seeking to market to the poor in emerging economies.},

This paper compares the household energy transitions in these nations through the analysis of both aggregate statistics and nationally representative household surveys. The two countries differ sharply in several respects. Residential energy consumption in China is twice that in India, in aggregate terms. In addition, Chinese households have almost universal access to electricity, while in India almost half of rural households and 10\% of urban households still lack access. On aggregate, urban households in China also derive a larger share of their total energy from liquid fuels and grids (77\%) as compared to urban Indian households (65\%). Yet, at every income level, Indians derive a slightly larger fraction of their total household energy needs from liquid and grid sources of energy than Chinese with comparable incomes. Despite these differences, trends in energy use and the factors influencing a transition to modern energy in both nations are similar. Compared with rural households, urban households in both nations consume a disproportionately large share of commercial energy and are much further along in the transition to modern energy. However, total energy consumption in rural households exceeds that in urban households, because of a continued dependence on inefficient solid fuels, which contribute to over 85\% of rural household energy needs in both countries. In addition to urbanisation, key drivers of the transition in both nations include income, energy prices, energy access and local fuel availability.},

Despite increasing awareness and the revolution in energy sources, a vast majority of households in developing countries continue to use solid fuels for cooking, which are considered to be harmful to both the environment and human health. This paper uses the World Bank's comprehensive living standard survey measurement data from Ethiopia, Malawi and Tanzania to analyze cooking fuel use patterns and their determinants. The descriptive analysis shows that a significant number of households use solid fuels for cooking and only a small fraction of households use clean fuels such as electricity, liquid petroleum gas. Rural households and those situated far from markets are more dependent on dirty fuels. Multinomial logit and ordered probit model estimation results show that female-headed households, household heads with a higher level of education, urban and wealthy households are more likely to use modern energy sources such as electricity and liquid petroleum gas (LPG), and are less likely to use solid fuels.},

During the last decade significant numbers of Bhutanese households have switched to cleaner energy sources. Empirical results show that a household׳s choice of cleaner energy sources is driven by income level and household wealth, the age, gender and education of the household heads, access to electricity, and location. Education and income have a differential role on the choice of clean or dirty fuel; wealthier and more educated households use and rely more on clean sources of energy like electricity and liquid petroleum gas while poorer households use and rely on dirty fuel such as fuelwood and kerosene. The study shows that female-headed households are more likely to choose cleaner fuels and, above all, the availability of a clean and cost-effective source of energy within proximity to the household is an important factor in the adoption of clean energy. Several models using a variety of alternative independent variables, such as proxies for education and wealth, were estimated and confirmed the robustness of the results.},

This paper analyzes the effect of households' socio-economic characteristics on choice of cooking fuel. A multinomial logit (MNL) model was used to estimate the determinants of fuel choice in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Nigeria. Data analysis shows that the patterns of fuel usage are consistent with the ‘energy stacking’ theory as fuelwood are often used alongside modern fuels, and majority of the households depend largely on fuelwood as its principal cooking fuel. Modern fuels thus have failed to displace traditional fuelwood. Empirical results of MNL model shows that household head's age, educational attainment, household size, income, type of dwelling unit, the duration of food cooked and price of fuelwood are statistically significant factors influencing households' choice of cooking fuel. Implications for regional and national fuel policies are discussed.},

What the record shows is that efficient technologies may well increase the efficiency of energy throughput but that promised reductions in energy demand seldom pan out. Confronted with this problem, the usual policy approach has been to work harder to get markets, incentives and information to loosen up the ‘barriers’ to technology penetration. Social scientists have been recruited to facilitate markets with better information and incentives, in other words, to improve the behaviour of energy end-users. The paper argues that both technologists and behaviouralists have oversimplified the ways that technologies and socio-cultural contexts interact to affect energy-using practices. The concept of distributed agency is introduced to capture the theoretical link between technology and behaviour. The examples of air conditioning and food refrigeration are used to illustrate these points.},

	abstract = {The global economy will face significant challenges over the next few decades. On the one hand, it must meet the needs of 7 billion consumers (growing to 9 billion by 2050), including the currently unmet basic needs of large numbers in developing countries in areas such as food, energy, housing and health. On the other hand, it must achieve this growth without exceeding the resources available on the planet or causing environmental devastation. This paper argues that such change is possible through a systemic shift to a frugal economy that involves radical, frugal innovation across sectors. Such a transformation will involve the participation of large and small firms, consumers and governments alike. The paper introduces the notion of frugal innovation—the creation of faster, better and cheaper solutions for more people that employ minimal resources—and discusses strategies and examples of such change already taking place in core sectors like manufacturing, food, automotive and energy in developing and developed economies. It also outlines the role of the interaction between large and small firms as well as between firms and consumers in making change possible, as well as the role of governments in driving change where market mechanisms alone will not suffice.

For this reason, the choice of selecting a carrier for a service (e.g. cooking) is expected to vary among individuals. To assess this, the study uses the 1999–2000 National Sample Survey (NSS) data covering over 118,000 households and analyses the rural and urban areas separately.

The relationship between energy and poverty is obvious and goes both ways. Recognizing this, this paper provides a short overview of different approaches to measuring energy poverty. It then presents a novel two-dimensional measure of energy poverty and energy distribution that combines the elements of access to different energy types and quantity of energy consumed. An assessment of the extent of energy poverty and changes in energy distribution pattern are analyzed by applying this measure to Indian household survey data for 1983–2000. The analysis shows a significant reduction in the level of energy poverty and a rapidly developing subcontinent. The new measure is a good complement to conventional monetary measures and is general enough to be applied to other developing countries.},

The paper uses data from nationally representative surveys of over 100,000 households. The paper concludes that the case for reducing LPG subsidies is strong. Although the kerosene subsidy is an inefficient means of subsidizing fuel use by the poor, reduction in it will need to be supported by other policies that would limit the adverse impacts.},

As a social science, geography has become more critical than ever to our understanding of how inhabitants of our planet interact and how the quest for energy is affecting economic and political stability everywhere. There is no avoiding the important interplay of energy, geography, and society. More, importantly, when we bring the three together it helps us better understand what we have created and what we will be facing. Despite its growing value, however, we have directed only periodic attention to the contributions of geography. Future research needs to consider the expansive concept of energy security as a place and context-specific condition. Energy externalities, spillovers, leakages, and free riders loom large as policy challenges with geographic dimensions. Understanding spatial variations in the link between affluence and pollution is important, because increased prosperity may eventually enable sustainable development. Facilitating the spatial diffusion of energy innovations and the process of technology learning are also key to solving energy/society problems. Finally, optimizing polycentrism as an approach to “scaling up” energy and climate policy would also benefit from geographic analysis.},

We illustrate this with the example of the MARKAL energy system model in the UK, a model that is also widely used internationally. In the UK, MARKAL modelling has a long history helping underpin government energy and climate policy. We trace the use of the model from its initial development in the mid-1970s to the present day, highlighting attributes that contribute to its role as a successful ‘boundary object’ for different but interconnecting energy policy communities. We suggest that changing images of the energy policy problem have enabled MARKAL to shift from an initial role in identifying technologies to reduce oil dependency to playing a key role in target-oriented climate policy. Furthermore, we argue that the ability of MARKAL to perform different roles for different groups has served to embed and institutionalise the model in the energy policy community. Moreover, the capacity of the model to represent detailed technology options has accorded with a technological focus that has suited prevailing, shared conceptions of the energy-climate policy problem.},

Several of these dimensions were central to our understanding of two transitional mechanisms in California: the Residential Building Code and the exploration of the potential of dispersed electric generators. The “people problems” of energy reach beyond the technical-science problems, and beyond educating the little people in the value of efficiency, conservation, and the impending exhaustion of fossil fuels. Indeed, they are central to any compilation of the factual basis of dispersed energy futures.

The research uses Social Practice Theory (SPT) to gain better understanding of homeowners’ practices and resulting electricity demand in middle-class households in Pakistan, with broader implications for other developing countries with similar climatic and socio-material contexts. Drawing on the works of Bourdieu (1984, 1997), Schatzki (2011) and Shove and Pantzar (2005), the study aims to unravel the connection between familiar domestic practices and the ‘uncanny’ electricity demand. Material and social constructs of ‘homely’ household practices related to comfort, lighting, cleanliness, cooking and ICT were studied in ten middle-class households in Lahore, Pakistan. The material arrays of the intermittent electricity provision system, modernistic prefigurations of spaces preferred by the middle-class and electrical appliances play an intrinsic role in shaping, and in turn being shaped by, everyday practices. Practices shaped by specific socio-cultural dimensions, such as social acceptance within the neighbourhood community, religious meanings, joint family structures, age disparities and gender segregation. The empirical study aims to further the conceptualisation of socially differentiated practices in domestic socio-material and cultural context of developing countries.},

This is not the only route to take. The authors develop an alternative approach, viewing energy supply and energy demand as part of the ongoing reproduction of bundles and complexes of social practice. In articulating and comparing these two positions they show how social-theoretical commitments influence the ways in which problems like those of reducing carbon emissions are framed and addressed. Whereas theories of practice highlight basic questions about what energy is for, these issues are routinely and perhaps necessarily obscured by those who see energy as an abstract resource that structures or that is structured by a range of interlocking social systems.},

	abstract = {Kerosene subsidy reform is a key policy concern in India and other developing countries. As kerosene is widely used for lighting in India, any price change will likely have considerable public welfare impacts on the large fraction of the poor who do not have access to reliable electricity supply for lighting. In this study, we assess historic kerosene use for residential lighting across population groups separated by urban/rural, expenditure, and electricity service levels using data from India. Consumption trends are used to inform a service demand model and evaluate how changes in fuel price, electricity connection, and supply reliability influence environmental, health and economic outcomes. We find that users relying on kerosene for supplemental lighting—in combination (‘stacked’) with electricity—accounted for 64\% of residential kerosene consumed for lighting in 2005. Tested scenarios that addressed service needs of supplemental users had the greatest welfare benefits, especially in the future. Scenarios reducing PM 2.5 emissions from kerosene lighting can avert between 50 and 300 thousand disability adjusted life years relative to a baseline scenario in 2030. Lighting kerosene is highly price sensitive, resulting in a drop in demand of 97\% in a scenario in which current subsidies are phased out by 2030. Deadweight loss of the subsidy in 2005 is estimated at \$200–950 million, with three quarters attributable to supplemental kerosene lighting. Support for cleaner lighting technologies not reliant on fossil fuel subsidies would appear to be ‘no regrets’ or ‘co-benefits’ options for India, and could be implemented in parallel with subsidy removal.},

	abstract = {Unreliable electricity supply is a major obstacle to economic development in countries such as India. While electricity problems in the rural areas are widely recognized, scholars have yet to analyze the situation in urban slums. Drawing on 2004–2005 survey data from the India Human Development Survey, we document the electricity situation in slums. We find that while households located in slums are less likely to have access to the electricity grid than other urban households, the situation is significantly better than in rural areas. Based on simulations, we find that a median household in a slum has 70\% chance of having electricity. This number decreases to 50\% for a household in a rural area and increases to 80\% for households in urban areas. As to daily hours of electricity available for connected households, urban slums also fall between other urban and rural areas. Finally, we show that these conditions vary considerably by state. Slums located in states with low corruption and leftist governments have better electricity access on average than those in states suffering from corruption or that are ruled by rightist parties.},

About 55\% of rural households and 93\% of urban households had access to electricity. The 2005 Indian Human Development Survey showed that on average, electricity availability (hours of supply per day) in rural and urban households were 14 and 19h, respectively (Desai et al., 2007). Using nationally representative data from Indian Human Development Survey, this study estimated the impact of electricity access and availability on two attributes of human well-being, viz. education and health attainment. It found a significant positive relationship between electricity availability and well-being in rural and urban households. Electricity accessibility, revealed a significant positive relationship only for rural households. The paper concludes with implications for electricity policy and infrastructure choices.},

I use multiple econometric approaches, including linear regression with an instrument variable and propensity-score matching with multiple treatment levels to represent supply availability. I find a robust income effect of access, and suggestive evidence of the effect of better supply availability.

	abstract = {Material efficiency, as discussed in this Meeting Issue, entails the pursuit of the technical strategies, business models, consumer preferences and policy instruments that would lead to a substantial reduction in the production of high-volume energy-intensive materials required to deliver human well-being. This paper, which introduces a Discussion Meeting Issue on the topic of material efficiency, aims to give an overview of current thinking on the topic, spanning environmental, engineering, economics, sociology and policy issues. The motivations for material efficiency include reducing energy demand, reducing the emissions and other environmental impacts of industry, and increasing national resource security. There are many technical strategies that might bring it about, and these could mainly be implemented today if preferred by customers or producers. However, current economic structures favour the substitution of material for labour, and consumer preferences for material consumption appear to continue even beyond the point at which increased consumption provides any increase in well-being. Therefore, policy will be required to stimulate material efficiency. A theoretically ideal policy measure, such as a carbon price, would internalize the externality of emissions associated with material production, and thus motivate change directly. However, implementation of such a measure has proved elusive, and instead the adjustment of existing government purchasing policies or existing regulations— for instance to do with building design, planning or vehicle standards—is likely to have a more immediate effect.},

As expected, urban energy consumption is growing rapidly, driven by the fast growth of urban centres. Although urban poor households in most cities of the region constitute over 50\% of the total households, the provision of modern energy services to these households does not seem to be receiving the requisite attention from policy makers. This article provides a brief overview of the urban energy sector in Africa, with special emphasis on energy services for the urban poor. The energy-consumption patterns among the urban poor households and small and micro-enterprises are assessed and options for improving the provision of modern energy services to the urban poor are proposed. The article is based on field survey studies of energy services for the urban poor undertaken in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Supporting data and information from other sub-Saharan African countries is used to validate key conclusions and recommendations.},

Household energy use varies by income group according to local fuel availability. Considerable differences between the marginal costs of supplying fuels and market prices paid by consumers have led to major misallocations of resources. When the results of this survey are compared to the results of the 1987 household energy survey, a significant shift by households toward kerosene and electricity away from fuelwood, charcoal and LPG is shown to have taken place. These shifts toward modern fuels are consistent with the claims of the households in the 1990 survey, and can largely be explained by fuel prices. Finally, an assessment of the lifeline tariff and the kerosene cross-subsidy demonstrate that the latter is a more effective method of ensuring the basic energy needs of the urban and rural poor.},

	abstract = {Two questionnaire surveys of fuel use by low-income households in Zimbabwe were conducted in four small towns in 1994, and in these towns plus four larger towns in 1999. An energy transition from wood through kerosene to electricity occurred (a) with rising household income, (b) with increasing electrification status among towns and (c) over time in the smaller towns, in spite of falling household incomes in two of the towns. Increasing discrepancy in the incomes of higher and lower income groups over time was not associated with greater divergence in their fuel choices. By 1999 electricity was used by almost all households in towns with good electricity supplies, while use of firewood in these towns was infrequent. However, even the wealthiest households continued to combine electricity with other fuels, usually kerosene. Electricity use by less affluent households is apparently limited by lack of connections in the home and by access to appliances, while fuel prices, which are subject to government subsidies and fell in real terms over 5 years, have been less important. Zimbabwe's urban domestic energy policy has had considerable success in terms of equity, but this is increasingly difficult to maintain given present economic and political uncertainty.},

The upper stratum of the poor may have the purchasing power to access butane gas. In addition, the article examines the relevance of the ‘energy ladder’ hypothesis. Generally, both at the aggregate level and for individual urban areas, the prediction from the hypothesis holds; but our results indicate that the relevance of the hypothesis weakens on lower levels of aggregation implying significant inter-city variations. Finally, demand equations for each fuel are econometrically estimated and the elasticities are used to examine price and income effects. The budget elasticities indicate that with economic growth, the demand for traditional fuels will increase. In addition, the cross-price elasticities show that increase in the price of a traditional fuel mainly shifts demand towards other traditional fuels rather than towards modern fuels. This slows down the transition towards modern fuels. The article concludes by presenting policy recommendations arising from the analysis.},

The overdependence on woodfuels has grave potential environmental and health hazards, so efforts are being made to popularize efficient energy devices, namely cookstoves. The paper establishes the linkage between the quantity of woodfuels consumed, and the level of real incomes and inflation respectively in the country using time series data from 1974 to 1987. A regression analysis indicates that the quantity of woodfuels consumed in the country is negatively and positively correlated to real incomes and inflation levels respectively. It is therefore concluded that the impact of real incomes and inflation and the continued overdependence on woodfuels should not be discounted. In light of this, efforts to introduce and popularize the utilization of efficient energy devices in the country ought to be facilitated by increases in real incomes, inflation control measures and improvement in the standard of living of the populace.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development goals (SDGs) have set the 2030 agenda to transform our world by tackling multiple challenges humankind is facing to ensure well-being, economic prosperity, and environmental protection. In contrast to conventional development agendas focusing on a restricted set of dimensions, the SDGs provide a holistic and multidimensional view on development. Hence, interactions among the SDGs may cause diverging results. To analyze the SDG interactions we systematize the identification of synergies and trade-offs using official SDG indicator data for 227 countries. A significant positive correlation between a pair of SDG indicators is classified as a synergy while a significant negative correlation is classified as a trade-off. We rank synergies and trade-offs between SDGs pairs on global and country scales in order to identify the most frequent SDG interactions. For a given SDG, positive correlations between indicator pairs were found to outweigh the negative ones in most countries. Among SDGs the positive and negative correlations between indicator pairs allowed for the identification of particular global patterns. SDG 1 (No poverty) has synergetic relationship with most of the other goals, whereas SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) is the goal most commonly associated with trade-offs. The attainment of the SDG agenda will greatly depend on whether the identified synergies among the goals can be leveraged. In addition, the highlighted trade-offs, which constitute obstacles in achieving the SDGs, need to be negotiated and made structurally nonobstructive by deeper changes in the current strategies.},

Energy poverty is an obvious indicator of poverty, which has serious effects on economic development, environment, and health. In this paper, we conducted a detailed analysis on fuel choice and usage behavior of different end-use activities in rural residential energy consumption. Using 717 household observations from micro-survey data in two counties of Shandong and Hebei province in 2016, we find that biomass is the dominant fuel used for cooking among all energy sources despite of obvious decreasing trend in recent years, accounting for 44\%. Clean energy used to cook increased markedly with a proportion of nearly 50\%. Solar energy is an ordinary fuel used for water heating except for biomass. Almost 90\% of households rely on coal for space heating in winter, and one-third of households have space heating for fewer than two months. Ownership of home appliances for basic needs is higher than that for hedonistic needs, and usage behaviors of some appliances are economical. Fuel accessibility of commercial energy have improved noticeably in rural areas, and the high proportion usage of biomass is affected by family income, usage habits, local resources, environmental recognition, education, and age. Since the negative effects of using solid fuels, it is urgent to cleanse biomass, develop new energy, and improve residents’ cognition about the consequences of using solid fuels.},

India's rapid economic growth has enabled the growing middle class to buy household appliances in increasing numbers. The consequent rise in energy consumption and GHG emissions can be significantly reduced if consumers are motivated by awareness and options in the market to buy energy efficient appliances. India has introduced a star rating scheme for appliances, and even without incentives consumers purchase star-rated appliances. The stock of household appliances is projected using the data of a national sample survey of household consumption, observed sale of star-rated appliances and projected consumption distribution. Estimated savings in households' electricity consumption from just four appliances, ACs, refrigerators, TVs, and ceiling fans, for which data were available, range from 52 bKwh to 145 bkwh in 2030, reductions of 10–27\%. The corresponding reduction in CO2 emissions will be between 42Mt and 116Mt in 2030.

We undertook a survey of energy demand and usage patterns in households in unelectrified villages in Uttar Pradesh, India to assess access to and utilisation of energy sources for lighting and cooking. The times of usage were recorded and analysed and the effect on usage patterns of transitioning from traditional to modern energy sources is assessed. We quantify the cost and greenhouse gas emissions of current energy use in order to provide a benchmark of potential mitigation through the use of renewable energy technologies: a typical household with kerosene lamps only for lighting spends INR 3243 (US\$50.67) and emits 381 kgCO2eq per year; households with modern cooking energy spend 17\% more through increased usage, but emit 28\% less greenhouse gases compared to those with traditional stoves only. Cell phone ownership was found to be 50\% amongst adults. We use demographic and utilisation data to construct an hourly demand profile of basic electricity demand extrapolated to each month of the year, and present an example of aspirational demand assess the impact of desirable appliances. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to highlight the daily and seasonal variation in total energy and power demand. A hybrid system, with solar power and battery storage meeting daytime demand and higher-capacity diesel- or biomass-powered generation meeting the remainder during evening peaks and winter months, would satisfy demand most effectively.},

The affordability of appliances, wealth, race and religion together, among other household characteristics, help explain the heterogeneity in appliance ownership at lower income levels.

The analysis of electricity consumption of appliances in AEH households showed that the consumption of electricity is mainly due to lighting, air circulation, water-heating and cooking. In non-AEH households, the end-uses accounting for most of the consumption of electricity are lighting, entertainment and air circulation. The survey also yielded the appliance elasticities and the degree of penetration of energy-efficient devices. As a result policy-makers can take corrective actions by promoting efficiency improvements in certain end-use devices so that increases in the penetration of these devices would not significantly affect the overall electricity requirement for the domestic sector.},

This paper presents an alternative scenario for Karnataka's electricity sector on the basis of the development-focused end-use-oriented (DEFENDUS) paradigm. The DEFENDUS scenario for energy demand and supply focuses on people-based development through the promotion of energy services, identifying technological opportunities for better utilisation of energy through a scrutiny of the end-uses of energy and adhering to a least-cost approach to the mix of energy supplies. Even though the DEFENDUS scenario involves the illumination of all homes in Karnataka, an emphasis on employment-generating industry, the energisation of all irrigation pumpsets up to the limit imposed by the groundwater potential and the establishment of decentralised rural energy centres in villages, it comes out with energy and power requirements in the year 2000 which are only about 38 per cent and 42 per cent respectively, of the LRPPP demand.

	abstract = {Energy use in developing countries is heterogeneous across households. Present day global energy models are mostly too aggregate to account for this heterogeneity. Here, a bottom-up model for residential energy use that starts from key dynamic concepts on energy use in developing countries is presented and applied to India. Energy use and fuel choice is determined for five end-use functions (cooking, water heating, space heating, lighting and appliances) and for five different income quintiles in rural and urban areas. The paper specifically explores the consequences of different assumptions for income distribution and rural electrification on residential sector energy use and CO2 emissions, finding that results are clearly sensitive to variations in these parameters. As a result of population and economic growth, total Indian residential energy use is expected to increase by around 65–75\% in 2050 compared to 2005, but residential carbon emissions may increase by up to 9–10 times the 2005 level. While a more equal income distribution and rural electrification enhance the transition to commercial fuels and reduce poverty, there is a trade-off in terms of higher CO2 emissions via increased electricity use.},

	abstract = {India’s recent macro-economic and structural changes are transforming the economy and bringing significant changes to energy demand behaviour. Life-style and consumption behaviour are evolving rapidly due to accelerated economic growth in recent times. The population structure is changing, thereby offering the country with the potential to reap the population dividend. The country is also urbanising rapidly, and the fast-growing middle class segment of the population is fuelling consumerism by mimicking international life-styles. These changes are likely to have significant implications for energy demand in the future, particularly in the residential sector. Using the end-use approach of demand analysis, this paper analyses how residential energy demand is likely to evolve as a consequence of India’s transformation and finds that by 2030, India’s commercial energy demand in the residential sector can quadruple in the high scenario compared to the demand in 2010. Demand for modern fuels like electricity and liquefied petroleum gas is likely to grow at a faster rate. However, there is a window of opportunity to better manage the evolution of residential demand in India through energy efficiency improvement.},

	abstract = {Energy use in buildings accounts for 38\% of global total final energy consumption, 45\% of which in OECD countries. According to the International Energy Agency the continuing demand for new large and small appliances, often with new functionality, is resulting in rapidly increasing electricity consumption in both the residential and service sectors. Appliances contribution to the residential electricity use is increasing. Also, appliances types are changing in our homes. This paper aims to find the trend of energy consumption of appliances in the building sector and describing the driver of this energy consumption. For doing so, a review of the literature available in the topic is summarized first. Trends show that appliances energy consumption is growing, but also that are disproportionately powered by electricity, mainly due to the proliferation of electronics and other small household devices, especially in OECD countries. This trend, which have already brought millions of households out of poverty in China and India and promises to continually improve standards of living throughout the developing world, will also have a major impact on appliance energy consumption as many more households will be able to afford basic equipment such as refrigerators and washing machines. Moreover, because appliances generally consume electricity instead of renewable fuels or direct combustion fuels, they carry a relatively large carbon footprint in countries where electricity production is carbon intensive. Finally, appliances present significant opportunities for efficiency improvement, since most of the appliances to be implemented in the near future still have to be produced.},

	abstract = {Before the mid-eighteenth century, most people lived in near-complete darkness except in the presence of sunlight and moonlight. Since then, the provision of artificial light has been revolutionised by a series of innovations in appliances, fuels, infrastructures and institutions that have enabled the growing demands of economic development for artificial light to be met at dramatically lower costs: by the year 2000, while United Kingdom GDP per capita was 15 times its 1800 value, lighting services cost less than one three thousandth of their 1800 value, per capita use was 6,500 times greater and total lighting consumption was 25,000 times higher than in 1800. The economic history of light shows how focussing on developments in energy service provision rather than simply on energy use and prices can reveal the 'true' declines in costs, enhanced levels of consumption and welfare gains that have been achieved. While emphasising the value of past experience, the paper also warns against the dangers of over-reliance on past trends for the long-run forecasting of energy consumption given the potential for the introduction of new technologies and fuels, and for rebound and saturation effects.},

In principle, probability is uniquely appropriate for the representation and quantification of all forms of uncertainty; it is in this sense that we claim that ‘probability is perfect’. In practice, people find it difficult to express their knowledge and beliefs in probabilistic form, so that elicitation of probability distributions is a far from perfect process. We therefore argue that there is no need for alternative theories, but that any practical elicitation of expert knowledge must fully acknowledge imprecision in the resulting distribution. We outline a recently developed Bayesian technique that allows the imprecision in elicitation to be formulated explicitly, and apply it to some of the challenge problems.},

We obtain qualitative descriptions of the uncertain parameters and a novel data set of probability distributions describing individual expert beliefs. We conduct a sensitivity analysis on weights for a linear opinion pool and show that aggregated median beliefs in 2030 are: for oil price \$120/barrel (90\% CI: 51, 272); for greenhouse gas price \$34/tCO2e (90\% CI: 5, 256) and for levelised cost of low-carbon electricity 17.1 US cents/kWh (90\% CI: 8.3, 31.0).

	abstract = {Solar energy is free, environmentally clean, and therefore it is accepted as one of the most promising alternative energy sources. The effective use of solar energy is hindered by the intermittent nature of its availability, limiting its use and effectiveness in domestic and industrial applications especially in water heating. Conversion of solar energy into thermal energy is the easiest and most used method. The efficiency of solar thermal conversion is around 70\% but solar electrical direct conversion system has an efficiency of only 17\%. Solar water heating systems are mostly suited for its ease of operation and simple maintenance. Many research papers revealed that the improvement on thermal efficiency of solar water heating systems resulted in techniques to improve the convection heat transfer. Solar water heating systems are classified into two broad categories as passive and active systems. Passive techniques have been used to improve the convective heat transfer. The techniques like insertion of twisted tapes and its geometry, etc., play a vital role to improve the performance of solar water heating systems. This review paper summarizes the previous works on solar water heating systems with various heat transfer enhancement techniques include collector design, collector tilt angle, coating of pipes, fluid flow rate, thermal insulation, integrated collector storage, thermal energy storage, use of phase change materials, and insertion of twisted tapes. This paper also discussed the methods to optimize and simulate the solar water heating systems to understand flow and thermal behavior in solar collectors that would lead to the improvement of the thermal performance of solar collectors.},

Solar water heating systems (SWHs) could be of interest under the CDM because they directly displace greenhouse gas emissions while contributing to sustainable development by reducing local pollutants. However, there are only three solar water heating projects under the CDM so far. An attempt has been made to estimate the CDM potential of SWHs in India in this study. Our estimates indicate that there is a vast theoretical potential of CO2 mitigation by the use of SWHs in India. The annual CER potential of SWHs in India could theoretically reach 27 million tonnes. Under more realistic assumptions about diffusion of SWHs based on past experiences with the government-run programmes, annual CER volumes by 2012 could reach 4–9 million and 15–22 million by 2020. This would require that the government sets the subsidy level for SWHs at a level that allows them to become viable with the CER revenue. From a macro-economic point of view this makes sense if the sustainability benefits are deemed sufficiently high to warrant promotion of this project type.},

While the skewed distribution of CDM projects across countries is well recognized, little attention has been given to the skewed distribution of CDM projects within a country like India. We examine the different factors that account for the regional distribution of renewable energy based CDM power projects in India using state-specific and renewable form-specific explanatory variables including natural potential, economic conditions, and government policies. We find that state implementation of fiscal incentive measures and CDM benefit-sharing were the most significant factors in locating these projects within the states, apart from natural renewable potential. In the top ten states, controlling for the government incentives and subsidies, the pre-installed renewable power capacity was also a significant factor. State financial incentives and CDM benefit clause were also found to be the most significant factor in the generation of certified emission reductions from CDM projects. Unfortunately states with relatively higher natural potential lost out on the additional product gains through CERs, and an important aspect of the CDM approach seems to have been missed in India — that of promoting development in other regions of the country which had natural potential.},

Extensive research has been performed to further improve the thermal efficiency of solar water heating. This paper presents a detailed review exclusively on the design aspects of SWH systems. The first part of the paper provides a consolidated summary on the development of various system components that includes the collector, storage tank and heat exchanger. The later part of this paper covers the alternative refrigerant technology and technological advancements in improving the performance as well as the cost effectiveness of the SWH system.},

	abstract = {A solar water heating system (SWHS) is a device that makes available the thermal energy of the incident solar radiation for use in various water heating applications. SWHS largely depends on the performance of the collector's efficiency at capturing the incident solar radiation and transferring it to the water. With today's SWHS, water can be heated up to temperatures of 60–80°C. Heated water is collected in a tank insulated to prevent heat loss. Circulation of water from the tank through the collectors and back to the tank continues automatically due to the thermosiphon principle. The hot water generated finds many end-use applications in domestic, commercial, and industrial sectors. India has the highest energy intensities in Asia. Very little investment and priority are being given to increase of the efficiency. On the other hand, the India has a high potential for developing energy production from renewable energy sources (RES): solar, water, wind and biomass. However, these potentials are not studied and exploited enough and the present situation for their utilization is not so good. Although energy is a critical foundation for economic growth and social progress of any country, there are many constraints for RES development in all of them (political, technological, financial, legislative, educational, etc.). Obviously, defining development strategies and new support measures is necessary since renewable energy sources can make an important contribution to the regional energy supply and security. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the solar water heating system (opportunities) in India.},

The method has been applied to estimate primary energy requirements in the household sector of a few surveyed villages typical of Nepal's different physiographical regions. Total useful energy is estimated considering the end-use efficiency of the devices employed for specific end-use activities. Relevance of the socio-economic variable for estimating end-use energy requirements for different villages varies according to the availability, price and choice of specific fuels for different end-use activities.},

The methodology includes the operationalization of this decent housing standard into materials and equipment; development of appropriate building archetypes; calculation of embodied and operating energy using a building simulation model; a parametric analysis to investigate the range of uncertainty in LCE and the attribution to different contextual conditions and energy savings measures. Results for the test case India showed that LCE of decent housing can significantly vary depending on climatic conditions, building typology, construction materials, technical equipment for space cooling-dehumidification and user behaviour. Embodied energy accounts for 27–53\% of the LCE, depending on the building type and climate. LCE savings of up to 44\% can be achieved with low embodied energy materials, building envelope insulation, ceiling fans and more efficient air-conditioning systems.},

	abstract = {In this study, the strength of association of the subjective measure of the freshness of the indoor spaces and the health care-seeking behavior of the occupants was evaluated in low-income tenement houses of Mumbai. Mixed-mode research methods were employed, where the household survey data and feedback from local authorities regarding the health status of the occupants in the tenement housing were used to formulate the qualitative policy variable for assessing the built environment-health nexus. Multi-zone airflow modeling and simulations were performed to estimate the local mean age (LMA) of air, which subjectively indicated the ‘freshness’ of the space. The results show LMA was within the range of 5 min and 48 min, with the majority of units having an LMA range of 5 and 15 min. A parametric analysis of the site-based wind-flow characteristics stressed the need of early design interventions based on its orientation and obstructions, such that the natural wind flow characteristics of the site are optimally utilized for effective cross-ventilation in the living spaces. The health care-seeking behavior of the occupants for respiratory diseases was found to be infrequent in the units that had relatively higher fresh air exchanges. This study has larger implications in terms of creating a way-forward for the local authorities in sustainable renewal and rejuvenation of the low-income tenement housing in Mumbai.},

Already, heating, ventilation and air conditioning account for 35\% of total primary energy in the United States, and are expected to reach similar proportions in China within 5 years. With increasing population in high temperature areas, electricity demand for increased air-conditioning usage may drive extreme electricity peak demands and total usage. This paper presents comparative estimates of peak and annual electric cooling and heating electricity usage at the city-scale, including both OECD and non-OECD member cities. Our results indicate that mature urban economies of the OECD exhibit a cooling electricity response of 35–90 Watts per °C per capita above room temperature for cooling (interquartile range of estimates). Tropical/subtropical cities outside the OECD (mostly in South Asia, Africa and the Middle East) currently demand just 2–9 W/°C/capita, indicating significant growth in temperature-dependent electricity demand as air conditioning is adopted. A similar story is unfolding on the heating side, with subtropical cities adopting electric resistive heaters, potentially precipitating additional electricity generation and delivery concerns, particularly electric resistance heating is adopted instead of heat pumps.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a source of information on thermal energy use in buildings, its drivers, and their past, present and future trends on a global and regional basis. Energy use in buildings forms a large part of global and regional energy demand. The importance of heating and cooling in total building energy use is very diverse with this share varying between 18\% and 73\%. Biomass is still far the dominant fuel when a global picture is considered; the role of electricity is substantially growing, and the direct use of coal is disappearing from this sector, largely replaced by electricity and natural gas in the most developed regions. This paper identifies the different drivers of heating and cooling energy demand, and decomposes this energy demand into key drivers based on a Kaya identity approach: number of households, persons per household, floor space per capita and specific energy consumption for residential heating and cooling; and GDP, floor space per GDP, and specific energy consumption for commercial buildings. This paper also reviews the trends in the development of these drivers for the present, future – and for which data were available, for the past – in 11 world regions as well as globally. Results show that in a business-as-usual scenario, total residential heating and cooling energy use is expected to more or less stagnate, or slightly decrease, in the developed parts of the world. In contrast, commercial heating and cooling energy use will grow in each world region. Finally, the results show that per capita total final residential building energy use has been stagnating in the vast majority of world regions for the past three decades, despite the very significant increases in energy service levels in each of these regions.},

We find the rising part of the temperature–electricity curve to become more pronounced over time implying an increase in cooling demand per unit increase in summer temperatures. The study therefore predicts the adverse effects of climate change on electricity demand to be asymmetrically distributed in different seasons in the future, resulting in a serious disequilibrium in the hot months.},

Recently the Government revised target for solar power capacity installation from 20GW to100GW by 2022. However, the solar industry faces a significant level of challenges in the areas of grid connectivity and evacuation infrastructure, regulatory \& policy developments, capacity utilization, initial capital investment, lack of innovative financing models, consumer awareness and acceptance. Authors suggest that by taking key strategic steps like creating, attracting investment climate, making easy access to financing, developing transmission and distribution infrastructure, skill development, and developing domestic component manufacturing industry - the challenges can be addressed.

The Tool is free to use, and offers five different techniques for eliciting univariate probability distributions. A key feature of the Tool is that users can log in from different sites and view and interact with the same graphical displays, so that expert elicitation sessions can be conducted remotely (in conjunction with tele- or videoconferencing). This will make probability elicitation easier in situations where it is difficult to interview experts in person. Even when conducting elicitation remotely, interviewers will be able to follow good elicitation practice, advise the experts, and provide instantaneous feedback and assistance.},

Analysis based on a propensity-score-weighted fixed-effects model finds that while electrification is associated with a broad range of social and economic benefits, the size of the effects depends importantly on the reliability of electricity service. Gaining access to electricity combined with a reliable power supply is associated with a 17 percent increase in income during the sample period, but gaining access to electricity alone is associated with only a 9.6 percent increase in income. The net gain from both increasing the access rate and reducing power outages in rural India is estimated to be US\$11 billion a year. Moreover, India's rural electrification policy appears to be progressive because lower-income households benefit more from access to electricity than higher-income households during the sample period.},

	abstract = {India's manufacturing sector has undergone many spatial adjustments since 1989, including, for example, the organized sector's migration to rural locations, the powerful rise of informal manufacturing within cities, and the development of intermediate cities for manufacturing. This paper investigates the impact of these spatial adjustments for electricity usage in India?s manufacturing sector. Striking spatial differences in energy usage exist, and whether spatial adjustments exacerbate or alleviate energy consumption strains is important for issues ranging from reducing India's power blackouts to stemming rising pollution levels. Using detailed surveys for the organized and unorganized sectors, the analysis finds that electricity usage per unit of output in urban plants declined steadily during 1989-2010. In the rural areas, by contrast, electricity consumption per unit of output for organized sector plants peaked in 2000 and thereafter declined. Decomposing the observed trends in aggregate electricity usage from 2000 onwards, the paper finds that most reductions in electricity usage per unit of output came from reductions in existing sites of activity (defined through state-industry-urban/rural cells). The second biggest factor leading to reduced usage was lower usage in fast-growing sectors. By contrast, spatial movements of manufacturing activity across India did not significantly change usage levels and may have even increased them. This appears to have been in part because of the split nature of the mobility, with organized and unorganized sectors migrating in opposite directions.},

	abstract = {Energy poverty has been recognised as one of the main impediments to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and reducing global poverty. In Africa two out of three households lack access to convenient, efficient and reliable forms of energy to satisfy their basic needs and to perform economic tasks. Many of the people rely on charcoal, firewood, residues, dung, kerosene and candles for cooking, heating and lighting. A business as usual scenario indicates that the situation is likely to remain unchanged in 2030 and may probably be made worse by climate change. The Thesis focuses on energy at the household. It explores households’ experiences with energy in Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana. It seeks to identify, understand and analyse households’ energy problems and the strategies used by energy poor households to address their energy problems. I tried to understand how access or lack of access to energy for cooking, lighting, heating and cooling impacted on the wellbeing of the people. I also sought to understand how energy and gender interact at the household level. The study found that not only is infrastructure to deliver energy weak, but in cases where infrastructures are available, physical access to energy is hampered by frequent shortages of LPG, irregular supply of grid electricity, frequent power cut, high cost of energy appliances (gas burners, cylinders, improved cookstoves, prepaid meters) and affordability problems among others. These greatly affect the socio-economic activities of members of the households particularly women who have a duty to secure fuel for activities such as cooking.},

	abstract = {Reference emission scenarios in the literature have been the target of criticisms that suggest they convey too optimistic views on spontaneous energy-GDP decoupling of emerging countries economies. This article focuses on the case of India. It explores the role of current suboptimalities of the Indian power sector (structural under-investment in the sector leading to capacity shortage, power cuts and low efficiency) on future energy-GDP decoupling. To do so, it uses a hybrid general equilibrium framework, in which these suboptimalities are explicitly introduced. The results highlight that whether the constraints on investments in the power sector persist or not leads to contrasted trends in energy-GDP decoupling and GHG emissions. Over the short-term, capital scarcity in the power sector constrains the development of energy-intensive activities and therefore leads to higher energy-GDP decoupling. But on the longer-term, constrains on the power sector capacity limits substitution from fossil fuels to electricity, which entails both a low energy-GDP decoupling and a constraint on GDP growth when oil prices are high. The alleviation of suboptimalities appears thus as an insurance policy towards future oil price increase.},

In 2003, the Government of India implemented a national reform to enhance the efficiency of the electricity grid. How did firm ownership of generators respond to this? We analyze data from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys, with more than a thousand firms surveyed first in 2002 and then again in 2005 for generator ownership and potential explanatory variables. We show that although the use of generators decreased in the years following the reform, the response was heterogeneous. Large firms and exporters continued to rely on generators upon reform, while small firms and domestic producers reduced their reliance on diesel generators. These findings suggest that large firms and exporters value the insurance against outages that generators provide more than small firms and domestic producers. If India is to reduce the reliance on generators of key firms in the national economy, further improvements in the electricity sector are needed.},

Here, a solar photo voltaic (SPV) system with pico hydro turbines (PHTs) and pump are used for minimizing the monthly electricity bill in a dynamic electricity pricing environment. Also, the available water in the open well is optimally used in order to minimize the residential electricity cost. In situations when either the price of the energy from the grid is low or when the available energy from the SPV system is in excess of the demand, the proposed model stores the energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water in a reservoir. The stored energy is then retrieved using PHTs which feeds the load at the time when the energy price is high. The depth of the well is used as the working head for the operation of turbines and are optimally scheduled in order to minimize the water flow rate (WFR). The two fold objectives, i.e., minimizing the electricity cost and minimizing the WFR, is converted into a single objective function and is solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO). The payback period for the proposed system, if implemented, is also investigated as a case study in India.},

Optimization studies are then carried out using Homer Energy software to determine the optimal system configuration which has the lowest cost of energy. Historical data of hourly solar irradiation and wind speed were also used in the study to obtain a realistic result. A special case study for the rural scenario with a partial connectivity to the grid is also conducted which is reminiscent to the poor reliability of supply in India. The study also gives a detail comparison between the various cost components, electrical productions, energy management and emissions for each of these systems. The results of optimization show reasonable cost of electricity for reliable supply of power for the various load configurations as compared to the actual grid prices.},

	abstract = {Over two-thirds of Indians use solid fuels to meet daily cooking energy needs, with associated negative environmental, social, and health impacts. Major national initiatives implemented by the Indian government over the last few decades have included subsidies for cleaner burning fuels like liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene to encourage a transition to these. However, the extent to which these programs have affected net emissions from the use of these improved fuels has not been adequately studied. Here, we estimate the amount of fuelwood displaced and its net emissions impact due to improved access to LPG for cooking in India between 2001 and 2011 using nationally representative household expenditure surveys and census datasets. We account for a suite of climate-relevant emissions (Kyoto gases and other short-lived climate pollutants) and biomass renewability scenarios (a fully renewable and a conservative non-renewable case). We estimate that the national fuelwood displaced due to increased LPG access between 2001 and 2011 was approximately 7.2 million tons. On aggregate, we estimate a net emissions reduction of 6.73 MtCO 2 e due to the fuelwood displaced from increased access to LPG, when both Kyoto and non-Kyoto climate-active emissions are accounted for and assuming 0.3 as the fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) harvested. However, if only Kyoto gases are considered, we estimate a smaller net emissions decrease of 0.03 MtCO 2 e (assuming fully renewable biomass harvesting), or 3.05 MtCO 2 e (assuming 0.3 as the fNRB). We conclude that the transition to LPG cooking in India reduced pressures on forests and achieved modest climate benefits, though uncertainties regarding the extent of non-renewable biomass harvesting and suite of climate-active emissions included in such an estimation can significantly influence results in any given year and should be considered carefully in any analysis and policy-making.},

This paper presents results of a study carried out in a forest fringe area of India on cooking energy use. The concept of calculating levelized cost as cost per unit of useful energy is applied on source–device combinations of cooking and validated in Bargaon Community Development Block of Sundergarh District in Odisha, India. About 92 \% of the households in the study area use fuelwood as the only energy source for cooking; the total use of fuelwood for only cooking, in the Block is nearly 1.8 times the total sustainable wood supply showing an urgent need for promoting alternative cooking energy options. This paper also presents an assessment of different cooking options in terms of cost per unit of useful cooking energy. LPG, biogas and gasifier stoves are found to be far too expensive for the local people. Briquette-fired improved stoves appear to be a promising cooking energy option in the study area. Government support and intervention are recommended for promoting this option.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread global efforts to promote clean cookstoves to achieve improvements in air and forest quality, and to reduce global climate change, surprisingly little is known about the degree to which these actually reduce biomass fuel consumption in real-world settings. Using data from in-house weighing of fuel conducted in rural India, we examine the impact of cleaner cookstoves ⿿ most of which are LPG stoves ⿿ on three key outcomes related to solid fuel use. Our results suggest that using a clean cookstove is associated with daily reductions of about 4.5kg of biomass fuel, 160 fewer minutes cooking on traditional stoves, and 105 fewer minutes collecting biomass fuels. These findings of substantial savings are robust to the use of estimators with varying levels of control for selection, and to alternative data obtained from household self-reports. Our results support the idea that efforts to promote clean stoves among poor rural households can reduce solid fuel use and cooking time, and that rebound effects toward greater amounts of cooking on multiple stoves are not sufficient to eliminate these gains. We also find, however, that households who have greater wealth, fewer members, are in less marginalized groups, and practice other health-averting behaviors, are more likely to use these cleaner stoves, which suggests that socio-economic status plays an important role in determining who benefits from such technologies. Future efforts to capture social benefits must therefore consider how to promote the use of alternative technologies by poor households, given that these households are least likely to own clean stoves.},

	abstract = {As part of a programme on ‘access to clean cooking alternatives in rural India’, induction stoves were introduced in nearly 4000 rural households in Himachal Pradesh, one of the few highly electrified states in India. Analysis of primary usage information from 1000 rural households revealed that electricity majorly replaced Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), generally used as a secondary cooking fuel, but did not influence a similar shift from traditional mud stoves as the primary cooking technology. Likewise, the shift from firewood to electricity as a primary cooking fuel was observed in only 5\% of the households studied. Country level analysis indicates that rural households falling in lower monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) classes have lesser access to electricity and clean cooking options than those falling in higher MPCE classes. Again, only three states in India with high levels of rural household electrification report consumption statuses more than 82kWh per month (the estimated mean for electricity consumption by induction stoves). Overall, the results of the study indicate that induction stoves will have limited potential in reducing the consumption of firewood and LPG if included in energy access programmes, that too only in regions where high levels of electrification exist.},

While such efforts continue, there is need to open up another front to attack this health hazard. Gas and electric cooking, which are clean at the household, are already the choice for one-third of Indians. Needed is a new agenda to make the “clean available”, i.e., to vigorously extend these clean fuels into populations that are caught in the Chulha Trap. This will require engaging new actors including the power and petroleum ministries as well as the ministry of health, which have not to date been directly engaged in addressing this problem. It will have implications for LPG imports, distribution networks, and electric and gas user technologies, as well as setting new priorities for electrification and biofuels, but at heart needs to be addressed as a health problem, not one of energy access, if it is to be solved effectively.},

	abstract = {Replacing traditional stoves with advanced alternatives that burn more cleanly has the potential to ameliorate major health problems associated with indoor air pollution in developing countries. With a few exceptions, large government and charitable programs to distribute advanced stoves have not had the desired impact. Commercially-based distributions that seek cost recovery and even profits might plausibly do better, both because they encourage distributors to supply and promote products that people want and because they are based around properly-incentivized supply chains that could more be scalable, sustainable, and replicable., The sale in India of over 400,000 “Oorja” stoves to households from 2006 onwards represents the largest commercially-based distribution of a gasification-type advanced biomass stove. BP's Emerging Consumer Markets (ECM) division and then successor company First Energy sold this stove and the pelletized biomass fuel on which it operates. We assess the success of this effort and the role its commercial aspect played in outcomes using a survey of 998 households in areas of Maharashtra and Karnataka where the stove was sold as well as detailed interviews with BP and First Energy staff. Statistical models based on this data indicate that Oorja purchase rates were significantly influenced by the intensity of Oorja marketing in a region as well as by pre-existing stove mix among households. The highest rate of adoption came from LPG-using households for which Oorja's pelletized biomass fuel reduced costs. Smoke- and health-related messages from Oorja marketing did not significantly influence the purchase decision, although they did appear to affect household perceptions about smoke. By the time of our survey, only 9\% of households that purchased Oorja were still using the stove, the result in large part of difficulties First Energy encountered in developing a viable supply chain around low-cost procurement of “agricultural waste” to make pellets. The business orientation of First Energy allowed the company to pivot rapidly to commercial customers when the household market encountered difficulties. The business background of managers also facilitated the initial marketing and distribution efforts that allowed the stove distribution to reach scale.},

The burner consists of a two-layer porous media. The combustion zone is made up of silicon carbide, and alumina balls forms the preheating zone. For a given burner diameter, the performances of the burner, in terms of thermal efficiency and emission characteristics, are analysed for different equivalence ratios and thermal loads (wattages). The water boiling test as prescribed in the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standard): 4246:2002 was used to calculate the thermal efficiency of both the conventional LPG cooking stoves and the PRB. The maximum thermal efficiency of the LPG cooking stoves with a PRB was found to be 68\% which is 3\% higher than that of the maximum thermal efficiency of the conventional domestic LPG cooking stoves. Unlike the conventional LPG stoves, for which the CO and NOX emissions were found in the ranges 400–1050 mg/m3 and 162–216 mg/m3, respectively, for the one with PRB, the same were in the ranges of 25–350 mg/m3 and 12–25 mg/m3. The axial temperature distribution in the burner showed that the reaction zone was close to the interface of the two zones and at a higher thermal load, it shifted towards the downstream. The surface temperature of the PRB was found to be uniform.},

Security of tenure, strengthened especially through notification of slums, appears to be one of the most important determinants of slum upgradation. Improvements of electricity and water supply spur improvements of other basic services. Better approach roads lead to better housing but motorable pucca (tarmac) approach road or proximity to motorable road reduces likelihood of better housing. Government is the major provider of services in slums. The role of NGOs in improvement of basic services within slums has declined over time along with decline in associations for slum improvement.

	abstract = {Background
Achieving development outcomes requires the inclusion of marginalised populations that have the least opportunity to participate in and benefit from development. Slum dwellers often see little of the ‘urban advantage’, suffering more from infectious diseases, increasing food costs, poor access to education and health care, inadequate water and sanitation, and informal employment. A recent Cochrane Review of the impact of slum upgrading strategies found a dearth of unbiased studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. The Review calls for greater use of process data, and qualitative alongside quantitative methods of evaluation. India is a lower middle income nation with large gender disparities and around 65 million slum inhabitants. The Asha Community Health and Development Society, a non-governmental organisation based in Delhi, has delivered a multi-sectoral program across 71 slums since 1988. This article reports on a mixed-method study to document measureable health and social impacts, along with Asha’s ethos and processes.

Methods
Several observational visits were made to 12 Asha slums where informal discussions were had with staff and residents (n = 50). Asha data records were analysed for change over time (and differences with greater Delhi) in selected indicators (maternal-child health, education, child sex ratio) using descriptive statistics. 34 semi-structured individual/small group interviews and 14 focus group discussions were held with staff, residents, volunteers, elected officials, civil servants, bankers, diplomats, school principals, slumlords and loan recipients (n = 147).

Results
Key indicators of health and social equity improved over time and compared favourably with those for greater Delhi. The Asha model emphasises rights, responsibilities, equity and non-violence. It employs strategies characterised by long-term involvement, systematic protocols and monitoring, development of civil society (especially women’s and children’s groups) to advocate for rights under the law, and links with foreign volunteers and fund-raisers. Stakeholders agreed that changes in community norms and living conditions were at least partly attributable to the Asha model.

Conclusions
While lacking a control group or complete baseline data, evidence suggested substantial improvements in slum conditions and social equity. The Asha model offers some lessons for slum (and broader) development.},

	abstract = {Guaranteeing tenure security to the households living in informal settlements (slums) has not seen any progress in urban India. This is because the policymakers have failed to see land tenure status as a continuum from insecure tenure to a legal status. In general, the poor in the cities move from informal to quasi-legal (de facto) tenure through various processes, and then to legal tenure (de jure) in cases of a public policy intervention that confers property title on them. In the absence of such a policy, the urban poor and low-income migrants can seek to consolidate their urban citizenship through political citizenship in an electoral democracy, through welfare interventions by the state and above all, through their own subversions of urban legalities. This article first illustrates the existence of a continuum of tenure status in informal settlements in Ahmedabad City. It explains the factors that give a slum settlement a particular level of tenure status; and then through quantitative data, links the level of tenure security to social protection outcomes. The article shows that through small public actions, it is possible to improve access of the urban poor to social protection measures and that it is not necessary to leapfrog to extending property rights to the dwellers of these informal settlements. It is essential to realise that if land titles are given in a society where other rights are not present, the poor will not be able to retain them.},

TT are defined as major, long-term technological changes in the way societal functions are fulfilled. TT do not only involve changes in technology, but also changes in user practices, regulation, industrial networks, infrastructure, and symbolic meaning or culture. This paper practices ‘appreciative theory’ [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on TT where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780–1900. Three particular mechanisms in TT are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth.},

This paper discusses aspects of R\&D and ‘learning-by-doing,’ the main contributors to technological change that are complementary yet inter-linked. The relationship between the level of national energy R\&D investments and changes in the trajectory of the country's energy system is complex; targeted efforts to promote deployment of new energy technologies play a major role in translating the results of R\&D activities to changes in the energy system. Learning-by-doing is an important element of deployment, but it remains largely poorly understood. Hence this phenomenon needs to be ‘unpacked’ and its various aspects analyzed in detail, so as to allow better design of early deployment efforts to enhance learning gains. This paper highlights how public R\&D and deployment efforts must work in tandem to expand the portfolio, and realize the potential, of new and improved energy technologies.},

As a case study, we have analyzed unelectrified rural areas in Assam state, India. We have developed an energy-economic model in order to analyze the possibility of electrification through dissemination of electric lighting appliances as well as applied multiple regression analysis to estimate the socio-economic condition, a literacy rate above 6 years old, in the areas. As a result of the case study, the household electrification rate, the 1000km2 road density, and sex ratio have been chosen as the explanatory variables of the literacy rate. Moreover, the model analysis shows that complete household electrification will be achieved by the year 2012. In combination with the multiple regression and model analysis, the literacy rate in Assam may increase to 74.4\% from 63.3\%.},

	abstract = {In this study, the impact of increased solar penetration in the electricity generation mix on residential electricity consumer bills is explored. The study comprises of two sections: simulation of wholesale electricity rates and retail rate modeling. In the first stage, wholesale prices were modeled using a bottom-up long term unit commitment optimization model for different energy mix scenarios based on increased solar penetration, ranging from 5 to 40\% on energy basis. The simulations indicated a fall in wholesale prices with increased solar penetration, a result of merit order effect. The simulated wholesale prices were then used to model retail rates for residential consumers. Four different types of retail rates were designed: flat rate, real time pricing, time of use and critical peak pricing. The impact of these retail rate mechanisms on electricity bills of residential consumers was analyzed and it was found that the bill savings achieved from time varying rates are greater than for time invariant rates. With increased solar penetration, customers with time-varying rates are likely to benefit the most from electricity bill savings. Although consumers with flat rate gain bill savings with increased solar penetration, the savings are likely to be lower than with time-varying rates.},

Energy planning at the village level is the bottom limit of the application of decentralised planning principle. The individual villages are the smallest social units where the energy consumption occurs. Renewable energy is energy derived from sources that are being replaced by nature, such as water, wind, solar or biomass. Renewable sources are essentially non-polluting if applied correctly. The paper presents a review of the important decentralised renewable energy options, related case studies of successful deployment of renewable energy technologies in India and resulting lessons learnt. Case studies discussed in the present work show the feasibility of decentralised energy options for the residential and small scale applications in a village or a cluster of villages. The paper also details the different initiatives taken by the government of India to promote decentralised energy production in India. It is found that the small scale power generation systems based on the renewable energy sources are more efficient and cost effective. Thus the focus should be on the small scale renewable energy technologies that can be implemented locally by communities and small scale producers, but can make a significant overall contribution towards the national energy supply.},

	abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) will play the leading role in addressing off-grid electricity access; it can be applied almost anywhere and used in a wide range of applications for households, businesses, institutions and communities. However, to fully exploit this opportunity, off-grid markets that need these solutions need to be effectively penetrated. This article focuses on delivery models for off-grid solar PV solutions and how they address barriers such as awareness, acceptance, access and affordability. It is based on a survey of 13 solar PV businesses in East Africa, supported by the Energy and Environment Partnership Programme and implementing the following delivery models: Retail, Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG), Consumer financing, Mini-grid and Fee-for-service. The survey is complemented by supporting literature and incorporates experiences from a University of Oslo research project on a village scale energy access model in Kenya and case studies of solar PV mini-grids in Senegal and India. Experiences from implementation of the different models are analyzed and generic descriptions provided. The models are compared to illustrate their suitability and effectiveness for delivering different levels of energy access. Retail and PAYG models are identified as effective at reaching scale, while the mini-grid and fee-for-service models demonstrate good potential to affordably and sustainably deliver a wider range of electricity access. The limitations of conventional rural electrification strategies are also discussed and the potential to incorporate some delivery models into electrification programs assessed.

	abstract = {The causal relationships between electrification and development of poor, rural communities are complex and contextual. The existing literature focuses mainly on the impact of rural electrification and electricity use on local socio-economic development, while the reverse feedbacks of various social and economic changes on electricity demand and supply have not been fully characterized. Most electricity access impact assessments assume linear, one-way effects and linear growth in electricity demand. However, the projections rarely match the reality, creating challenges for rural utilities. From a modelling perspective, the lack of attention to dynamic complexities of the electricity-development nexus prevents the appropriate modelling of electricity demand over time and, hence, informed planning for and sizing of power plants. With the goal to improve modelling of the electricity-development nexus, we undertake a comprehensive review and extensive analysis of the peer-reviewed literature on electricity access and its impact on rural socio-economic development, and vice versa. We characterize and describe the nexus between electricity access and development through graphical causal diagrams that allow us to capture, visualise and discuss the complexity and feedback loops. Based on this, we suggest guidelines for developing appropriate models able to include and simulate such complexities. Our analysis confirms that electricity use is interconnected through complex causal relations with multiple dimensions of socio-economic development, viz. income generating activities, market production and revenues, household economy, local health and population, education, and habits and social networks. The causal diagrams can be seen as a first step of the conceptualization phase of model building, which aims at describing and understanding the structure of a system. The presence of multiple uncertain parameters and complex diffusion mechanisms that describe the complex system under analysis suggests that systems-dynamic simulations can allow modelling such complex and dynamic relations, as well as dealing with the high uncertainties at stake, especially when coupled with stochastic approaches.},

	abstract = {Biotic pressure in and around protected areas (PA) is the primary cause of biodiversity loss in many developing countries across the globe. The pressure comes partly from biomass energy dependency in the form of heavy extraction of fuelwood from the forests. Although biomass fuels provide easily accessible and affordable sources of domestic energy to the rural masses, their combustion results in environmental and health-related hazards. The objectives of this paper are to assess the patterns of household energy use in a subsistence forest economy and analyze the factors that influence their energy use choice for cooking and lighting. The paper uses primary data collected randomly from 244 households located in and around the Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR), situated in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Age of the household head, number of days in wage employment, number of adult males and females in a household, education of the household head and landholding size are found to be the major variables that determine household fuelwood collection sources inside the reserve. Considering household structure as an income indicator, the analysis clearly shows that non-poor households prefer to use clean energy (i.e. solar) for lighting, while poor households tend to use solid fuel. Energy policies for development should be based on the realistic proposition that fuelwood will remain the major source of energy for cooking for substantial proportions of the world’s population. Promotion of public education, social forestry schemes and fuel-efficient improved chulhas should be encouraged in order to reduce household dependence on fuelwood. Moreover, devolving sufficient property rights over forest resources to local communities may help secure their broad-based and active participation in the decision-making process, which may result in a positive change in the attitude of the local people towards biodiversity conservation.},

We use an agricultural household dynamic programming model that includes two types of households differentiated by their socio-economic characteristics and that are linked through agricultural contracts. Households are also differentiated by their membership in terms of men, women and children. The model simulates the effects of policies such as state subsidies for the purchase of solar panels, improvement in non-agricultural employment opportunities, and combinations of the two, as they are suggested to improve energy supply and reduce trade-offs in energy use. The model results indicate that households improve energy use patterns by using solar panels; yet, adoption of such technology is conditional on state subsidy levels of 50\% and 80\% for the purchase of solar panels for farming and domestic purposes respectively. Subsidies for solar panels together with improvement of off-farm work increases off-farm employment levels and income of the poorer household, however, this policy reduces agricultural production. In addition, the wealthier household incurs losses from improvement in non-agricultural employment opportunities due to reduced labor availability for farm operations.},

The study contributes significantly to the understanding of the role of microgrids in complementing a centralized system and its value as a sustainable energy solution for development. Electricity reliability, power, price, and hours availability are studied through a choice experiment, a method uniquely able to disaggregate the willingness to pay for each attribute. Household surveys were carried out in 22 villages across 4 districts in the state and covering a total of 216 households. Results indicate that consumers value (in order of strength of preference) electricity power, reliability, and price. Further, despite 9.4h of electricity supply per day from the main grid, as compared to an average of only 7.2h from microgrids, the respondents exposed to both systems were almost twice as satisfied with the microgrid's reliability. Based on these findings, the study provides four policy recommendations for strengthening the rural electricity supply sector and enhancing electricity access in India.},

Using spatial data on insolation, census records, and original surveys, we show that remote and poor but large villages with abundant sunshine have led the wave of solar technology adoption as an alternative to grid electricity. At the household level, however, wealth and financial access are positively associated with solar technology adoption, a result that holds for both solar lanterns and home systems. Moreover, remote villages are more likely to see solar technology adoption when households have access to finance through banks. We also find that the use of household solar technology is strongly associated with a household's subjective satisfaction with domestic lighting. These results demonstrate that understanding solar technology adoption requires considering both community and household characteristics. They also underscore the importance of financial access as a precondition for using distributed solar power as an alternative to grid connectivity.},

	abstract = {While the literature on the social acceptance of new technologies focuses on industrialized societies, concerns about new technologies are often deeper and more widespread in developing countries. In a survey experiment with 3208 villagers from six major states of northern India, we examine the social acceptance of off-grid solar power as an alternative to grid extension. By randomly assigning different frames about this energy technology to the villagers, we study how concerns about the cost of sustainable energy, inequality of energy access, and the role of private business and the state shape individuals’ acceptance of off-grid solar power. We find that concerns about the role of private business and possible increases in rural-urban inequality are salient among the rural population. The rural population is concerned about (i) exploitative businesses practices and (ii) the inequality that solar power in villages is more expensive than conventional grid power in urban areas. These findings show that the social acceptance of new, sustainable energy technologies cannot be taken for granted in rural development and offer insights into the salience of different varieties of concerns.},

	abstract = {In the programme of total electrification, centralized supply of power generated by conventional methods using exhaustible resources is proving to be uneconomic and, more importantly, unmanageable so far as supply to rural areas, particularly remote places, are concerned. On the other hand, the decentralized approach based on supply of power produced with renewable energy resources available locally is, for various reasons, gradually being recognized as a viable alternative for such remote places. The present paper attempts to examine, from a broad-based socio-economic and environmental point of view, the feasibility of decentralized solar photovoltaic (SPV) system as a source of power compared to that from conventional sources in a remotely located island. The study, based on a sample survey, conducted in an island called ‘Sagar Dweep’ in West Bengal, India, shows that within a short spell of time of four years, there have been noticeable improvements and significant impact on education, trade and commerce, entertainment, health etc. as a result of supply of power from SPV power plants. Productivity level of some agricultural activities as well as women's participation in different economic activities (at night) other than household work have shown definite signs of betterment. The SPV system is also superior to other conventional systems on consideration of its environmental effects. Thus, on the whole, there seems to be a strong case for the locally installed SPV system in spite of its current unfavourable position in respect of the direct cost of production.},

It is observed that India follows income-based ladder starting with fuelwood and ending with sophisticated fuels like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity. This paper discusses cooking energy dissemination in the country with an objective of understanding the underlying socioeconomic factors governing the utilization of various fuels/energy carriers in cooking. The diffusion of renewable energy devices is observed to be far below their estimated potential.

This study seeks to study the impact of the transition from Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) to Light Emitting Diodes based lights (LED) on the solar home lighting system market. Changing the lighting fixtures from CFL to LED would lead to the requirement of smaller panels and batteries and consequently, a reduction in prices. Would this reduction significantly increase the adoption of these systems? Would the requirement for financing or government support change? To understand this changing landscape of the rural solar lighting industry, this study analyses the current products, distribution network, and operations of seven diverse solar firms operating in different parts of India. Four of these firms exclusively make LED based products – lanterns and small home lighting systems – and the rest have some LED based systems in their portfolio. There are several factors to be considered, product configuration, luminosity, price effects and service and maintenance. While the price reduction is found to be significant (about 20\%), affordability may still remain an issue for poorer households. LED lighting allows for the introduction of plug and play systems, and reduces institutional requirements for installation and maintenance.},

We conducted the surveys in collaboration with a local solar enterprise, Boond, and chose villages that are prime locations for the installation of solar home systems. We found that high household income and education levels, as well as young age, predict awareness of SHS products. In addition to wealthy and educated households, willingness to pay is higher in households that have electricity. The findings can help policymakers identify and target households with low levels of awareness and solar entrepreneurs identify suitable customers for their products.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this research is to determine the characteristics of households installing solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Bangladesh, a developing country, where rural electrification, improvement of rural livelihoods and sustainable development constitute the primary development agenda. This article attempts to determine quantitatively the factors that affect the two main purchase decisions of PV systems, or solar home systems (SHS). The first purchase decision is the adoption of SHS, the determinants of which are examined using a binary probit model that analyzes the characteristics of households with SHS and without SHS. The second purchase decision is the size of the SHS, the determinants of which are assessed using an ordered probit model for the households using SHS. The results indicate that household income, ownership of rechargeable batteries, kerosene consumption, and the number of mobile phones are the key determinants of the adoption of SHS. While household income is identified as one of the key determinants, this study shows that household income alone cannot explain adequately the variation in households' SHS adoption. Moreover, the analysis of the choice of SHS capacity also finds that the size of SHS chosen by households is related significantly to the level of kerosene consumption, the number of children, the concern about indoor pollution, and the need for electric lighting in addition to household income. A key message from the findings of this research is that nonincome factors play a significant role in the dissemination of SHS in rural Bangladesh as the level of kerosene consumption is found to have a strong influence on the decision to start using SHS. This research argues that household income is not a sufficient basis for determining the latent demand for SHS in rural Bangladesh.},

Drawing on both classic and modern research from cognitive psychology, social psychology, and survey methodology, the authors examine how survey responses are formulated and they demonstrate how seemingly unimportant features of the survey can affect the answers obtained. The book provides a comprehensive review of the sources of response errors in surveys, and it offers a coherent theory of the relation between the underlying views of the public and the results of public opinion polls. Topics include the comprehension of survey questions, the recall of relevant facts and beliefs, estimation and inferential processes people use to answer survey questions, the sources of the apparent instability of public opinion, the difficulties in getting responses into the required format, and the distortions introduced into surveys by deliberate misreporting.},

This behaviour, called satisficing, can take the form of either (1) incomplete or biased information retrieval and/or information integration, or (2) no information retrieval or integration at all. Satisficing may lead respondents to employ a variety of response strategies, including choosing the first response alternative that seems to constitute a reasonable answer, agreeing with an assertion made by a question, endorsing the status quo instead of endorsing social change, failing to differentiate among a set of diverse objects in ratings, saying ‘don't know’ instead of reporting an opinion, and randomly choosing among the response alternatives offered. This paper specifies a wide range of factors that are likely to encourage satisficing, and reviews relevant evidence evaluating these speculations. Many useful directions for future research are suggested.},

This paper offers such a theory drawn from a variety of psychological research. Using data from a split-ballot experiment in the 1984 General Social Survey involving a variant of Kohn's parental values measure, we test some predictions made by the theory about what kind of response order effect would be expected (a primacy effect) and among which respondents it should be strongest (those low in cognitive sophistication). These predictions are confirmed. We also test the "form-resistant correlation" hypothesis. Although correlations between items are altered by changes in response order, the presence and nature of the latent value dimension underlying these responses is essentially unaffected.},

	abstract = {Hidden populations, such as injection drug users and sex workers, are central to a number of public health problems. However, because of the nature of these groups, it is difficult to collect accurate information about them, and this difficulty complicates disease prevention efforts. A recently developed statistical approach called respondent-driven sampling improves our ability to study hidden populations by allowing researchers to make unbiased estimates of the prevalence of certain traits in these populations. Yet, not enough is known about the sample-to-sample variability of these prevalence estimates. In this paper, we present a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around respondent-driven sampling estimates and demonstrate in simulations that it outperforms the naive method currently in use. We also use simulations and real data to estimate the design effects for respondent-driven sampling in a number of situations. We conclude with practical advice about the power calculations that are needed to determine the appropriate sample size for a study using respondent-driven sampling. In general, we recommend a sample size twice as large as would be needed under simple random sampling.},

	abstract = {Based on field research in Coimbatore in 1980, this paper discusses several theories concerning the character and role of 'small-scale' production in relation to the industrial economy as a whole. A distinction is made between small capitalist units of production and 'petty commodity producer' units. The patterns of ownership and financing of both types of units are considered, and the character of the linkages between different forms of production is examined in some detail. The extent of subcontracting between big capital industries and small units is shown to be considerable, and the interests of big industry in the splitting up of production processes in order to tighten the control of labour are demonstrated. The backgrounds and social characteristics of workers in different levels of industry, in casual work and in self-employment are also analysed; and the degree of segmentation existing within the labour market is shown to be high. Conclusions are drawn on the processes of reproduction of different forms of small-scale production; and it is argued that while they are subordinated in various ways to big capital production their persistence is ensured by the interests of big capital itself, and by the structure of markets, in particular. The paper has been published in two parts. The first part which appeared last week, dealt with patterns of ownership and financing, linkages between different forms of production, sub-contracting and splitting up of production processes. This second part deals with the backgrounds and social characteristics of workers and the degree of segmentation in the labour market and also presents the author's conclusions.},

Acknowledging the existing data constraints, a more focussed household energy survey was designed for rural India with the aim of better understanding determinants of current energy use patterns, energy choices, to measure the impacts of these factors, and importantly, arrive at key policy insights. This paper revisits the definition of access to include for reliability and quality going beyond conventional understanding. It also relooks at the role of gender in household energy choices. Having established that apart from income, socio-cultural factors may have a greater role in determining household energy choices, the model results indicate electricity access would have a positive impact on cooking energy choices only after meeting a minimum threshold requirement. As women move towards more formal employment, the odds of choosing cleaner fuels increase significantly. Thus, while macro-policies may provide important guidelines and the necessary framework, implementation strategies need to be designed at the local level through a participatory approach making energy an integral part of the development paradigm.},

In the case of India, they use both kerosene and electricity for lighting while cooking with both LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and traditional biomass. Existing scholarship on fuel stacking largely relies on small surveys and does not investigate change over time. We leverage the nationally representative NSS (National Sample Survey) of India in 1987 and 2010, finding that fuel stacking is decreasing in lighting, as people substitute electricity for kerosene, but increasing in cooking, as LPG does not replace traditional biomass. We also exploit a two-stage statistical model to analyze individual household's decision of fuel stacking. The most important finding is that, while a high household income reduces fuel stacking for lighting, it no longer does so in 2010 for cooking. The main policy implication of the study is that much more aggressive efforts are needed to deal with problems associated with biofuels, such as indoor air pollution, than to induce the switch from kerosene to electricity. The statistical model offers a considerable improvement over existing alternatives in the literature on household energy access.},

	abstract = {Background
Clustering is a widely used collection of unsupervised learning techniques for identifying natural classes within a data set. It is often used in bioinformatics to infer population substructure. Genomic data are often categorical and high dimensional, e.g., long sequences of nucleotides. This makes inference challenging: The distance metric is often not well-defined on categorical data; running time for computations using high dimensional data can be considerable; and the Curse of Dimensionality often impedes the interpretation of the results. Up to the present, however, the literature and software addressing clustering for categorical data has not yet led to a standard approach.

Results
We present software for an ensemble method that performs well in comparison with other methods regardless of the dimensionality of the data. In an ensemble method a variety of instantiations of a statistical object are found and then combined into a consensus value. It has been known for decades that ensembling generally outperforms the components that comprise it in many settings. Here, we apply this ensembling principle to clustering., We begin by generating many hierarchical clusterings with different clustering sizes. When the dimension of the data is high, we also randomly select subspaces also of variable size, to generate clusterings. Then, we combine these clusterings into a single membership matrix and use this to obtain a new, ensembled dissimilarity matrix using Hamming distance.

Conclusions
Ensemble clustering, as implemented in R and called EnsCat, gives more clearly separated clusters than other clustering techniques for categorical data. The latest version with manual and examples is available at https://github.com/jlp2duke/EnsCat.},

	abstract = {Summary.? Data with mixed-type (metric?ordinal?nominal) variables are typical for social stratification, i.e. partitioning a population into social classes. Approaches to cluster such data are compared, namely a latent class mixture model assuming local independence and dissimilarity-based methods such as k-medoids. The design of an appropriate dissimilarity measure and the estimation of the number of clusters are discussed as well, comparing the Bayesian information criterion with dissimilarity-based criteria. The comparison is based on a philosophy of cluster analysis that connects the problem of a choice of a suitable clustering method closely to the application by considering direct interpretations of the implications of the methodology. The application of this philosophy to economic data from the 2007 US Survey of Consumer Finances demonstrates techniques and decisions required to obtain an interpretable clustering. The clustering is shown to be significantly more structured than a suitable null model. One result is that the data-based strata are not as strongly connected to occupation categories as is often assumed in the literature.},

	abstract = {Modern society depends on the flow of information over online social networks, and users of popular platforms generate substantial behavioural data about themselves and their social ties1–5. However, it remains unclear what fundamental limits exist when using these data to predict the activities and interests of individuals, and to what accuracy such predictions can be made using an individual’s social ties. Here, we show that 95\% of the potential predictive accuracy for an individual is achievable using their social ties only, without requiring that individual’s data. We used information theoretic tools to estimate the predictive information in the writings of Twitter users, providing an upper bound on the available predictive information that holds for any predictive or machine learning methods. As few as 8–9 of an individual’s contacts are sufficient to obtain predictability compared with that of the individual alone. Distinct temporal and social effects are visible by measuring information flow along social ties, allowing us to better study the dynamics of online activity. Our results have distinct privacy implications: information is so strongly embedded in a social network that, in principle, one can profile an individual from their available social ties even when the individual forgoes the platform completely.},

	abstract = {Single-discipline research may have limited effectiveness if it fails to take into account cogent knowledge from other fields, and especially if fails to communicate using terms that are meaningful to other disciplines and to policy makers. In the energy field, interdisciplinary research is needed to address the many complex and urgent socio-technical issues involved in achieving a more sustainable future. However, the terminology and specialised concepts that are integral to disciplines can create barriers to a comprehensive understanding of a shared field of inquiry. In energy sciences the common language of mathematics is used to help in understanding of the quantitative concepts of energy and its transformations, while the social sciences use both qualitative and quantitative means to describe society and social relationships, using the subtly different languages that are associated with different social theories. If these barriers to communication can be bridged, the benefits can be immense. I illustrate some of the misunderstandings that can occur in conversations between social and physical scientists with an imaginary dialogue. I conclude that, to work effectively across disciplines, social scientists will need to learn something of what energy means, and physical scientists will need to learn something of what energy means.},

	abstract = {Noting the recent decline in the coal consumption in China, a variety of prior literature studies the peak of coal consumption and finds mixed results. This paper systematically studies the historical rules, the driving mechanism, as well as the future trend of coal consumption in China. First, through comparative analysis and breakpoint regression, we find that there are three consecutive inverted U-shapes between China's coal consumption and economic development from 1965 to 2016, and they reach inflection points in 1980, 1998, and 2013, respectively. Second, the LMDI decomposition analysis of coal consumption reveals that output effects and intensity effects jointly determine the overall trend of each inverted U, and structural effects play a key role in the formation of each inverted U-shaped inflection point. Finally, the forecast shows that coal consumption will decline at an average annual rate of 0.4\% from 2017 to 2030, and by then it will be basically in a plateau period. There is a big gap between the consumption trend and the inverted U scenario. In order to bend the coal consumption curve downward and ensure that 2013 will become a long-term peak, the government should accelerate the optimization of the industrial structure and energy consumption structure, and improve coal consumption efficiency continuously through a mix of policies.},

The advantage of this method lies in its computational savings and its robustness to misspecification in the number of breaks. The number of least-squares regressions required to compute all of the break points is of order T, the sample size. Each estimated break point is shown to be consistent for one of the true ones despite underspecification of the number of breaks. More interestingly and somewhat surprisingly, the estimated break points are shown to be T-consistent, the same rate as the simultaneous estimation. Limiting distributions are also derived. Unlike simultaneous estimation, the limiting distributions are generally not symmetric and are influenced by regression parameters of all regimes. A simple method is introduced to obtain break point estimators that have the same limiting distributions as those obtained via simultaneous estimation. Finally, a procedure is proposed to consistently estimate the number of breaks.},

With that promise comes the expectation to boost socio-economic well-being of newly-connected households, who will continue climbing up the energy ladder. Despite the growing appreciation for the need to go beyond the techno-economics of energy access, and the recognition of the value of socio-technical systems perspective, the wider sociology of energy consumption and behaviour among adopters of off-grid solar solutions has been poorly explored. In this paper, we apply the Social Practice Theory (SPT) and the energy and solar energy ladder framework to analyse energy consumption and the changing social practices of SHSs users in Rwanda. We find that social practices change dynamically and depend on available appliances, whereas energy consumption follows a complex path but does not increase in a linear manner with time or more appliances. Insights can prove useful for public and private agencies working on off-grid electrification, offering a new perspective on the energy and solar energy ladder concepts while also showing the importance of social aspects of energy access even at relatively low levels of provision currently offered by SHSs.},

	abstract = {Access to reliable, affordable and sustainable energy is essential for improving living standards, development and economic growth. From a healthcare perspective, energy is a critical parameter for delivering and improving healthcare services and life-saving interventions in the Global South. This review provides an estimation of the energy needs of different healthcare facilities as a function of patient capacity and services provided. It also presents the strengths and limitations of several energy sources that can be used to meet these needs. The review focuses on energy provision in off-grid scenarios and for satisfying peak demands of grid-connected hospitals. The initial key observations are that fossil-fuel generators are the main energy source because of their low investment costs. However, this technology can no longer compete with the energy produced from renewable sources in terms of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Photovoltaics (PV) has an LCOE of 0.09USD/kWh, versus an average 0.25USD/kWh for diesel generators. Moreover, PV is a modular technology that can efficiently meet energy demands in an environment-friendly way. Wind turbines share many strengths of PV and yet both technologies suffer from intermittent energy sources. They must therefore be coupled with a storage system that provides continuous and stable electricity. Today, energy is mainly stored electrochemically, in the form of lead-acid batteries. However, this review shows that nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) should be used when possible for their higher energy density (200Wh/l versus 80Wh/l), non-toxicity, safety and simple maintenance. Alternatively, lithium-based batteries should be used when the energy density and number of cycles is a priority. Other energy production means (e.g., hydropower) and storage technologies (e.g., flywheels) are reviewed as well. In conclusion, the optimal energy solution for medium-to-large healthcare facilities, especially for those in off-grid settings, is a hybrid system wherein the strengths of a renewable energy source coupled with efficient batteries is combined with a diesel generator to minimize the LCOE.},

This project will develop an effective intervention to change the behaviour of above-average energy users via training them to use smart tools and coaching them throughout the process. The aim is to increase knowledge of the energy market, change thinking patterns, initiate smarter decisions and through this create actual change in consumers’ behaviour – in pilot test group energy consumption is expected to decrease by 5–10\%. This project will integrate at least seven third party digital energy tools with the Estfeed platform that connects over 600 000 energy users in Estonia.

	abstract = {For the past 40 years, the dominant \&lsquo;policy\&rsquo; on cooking energy in the Global South has been to improve the combustion efficiency of biomass fuels. This was said to alleviate the burdens of biomass cooking for three billion people by mitigating emissions, reducing deforestation, alleviating expenditure and collection times on fuels and increasing health outcomes. By 2015, international agencies were openly saying it was a failing policy. The dispersal of improved cookstoves was not keeping up with population growth, increasing urbanisation was leading to denser emissions and evidence suggested health effects of improved stoves were not as expected. A call was made for a new strategy, something other than \&lsquo;business as usual\&rsquo;. Conventional wisdom suggests that access to electricity is poor in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), that it is too expensive and that weak grids prevent even connected households from cooking. Could a new strategy be built around access to electricity (and gas)? Could bringing modern energy for cooking to the forefront kill two birds with one stone? In 2019, UK Aid announced a multi-million-pound programme on \&lsquo;Modern Energy Cooking Services\&rsquo; (MECS), specifically designed to explore alternative approaches to address cooking energy concerns in the Global South. This paper outlines the rationale behind such a move, and how it will work with existing economies and policies to catalyse a global transition.},

This ‘hero story’, where society is ‘saved’ by clever technologies, is inspiring, positive and familiar. An alternative is the ‘learning story’, where things are not quite as simple as they first seemed. In a learning story, protagonists are normal people who need to overcome a challenge. In energy policy, the learning story could address the gap between the technical potential and what is achieved in practice. Three real-world examples from retrofit and new-build projects are used to show how implicit narratives can create conflict when the tellers (e.g. researchers) have to tell one kind of story but have data for the other. Recommendations are provided for a balanced approach to the deployment of different kinds of tales by policy-makers, researchers, implementers and users. Harnessing the learning story and developing a ‘caring story’ could motivate policy-makers and the public to invest effort in building performance.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to identify and understand the challenges that may confront the scaling up of a proposed battery electric cooking concept (Batchelor 2013), eCook, which offers the potential for emission free cooking, with time/money savings and broader environmental benefits from reduced fuelwood/charcoal consumption. By drawing on the literature on the transition to electric cooking in South Africa and more broadly, literature from across the Global South analysing the uptake of ICS (improved cookstoves), LPG (liquid petroleum gas) and solar home systems, this study identifies the factors (e.g. successful delivery models and marketing strategies) that have enabled these innovations to reach scale. This knowledge is then related to the eCook concept, by identifying the potential users of this promising technology and outlining potential marketing strategies, as well as a user-focused iterative design process, that will enable social enterprises to reach them. Uptake is predicted to be most rapid in hot climates where fuelwood/charcoal is purchased and low energy diets and low power cooking devices are the standard. Mobile enabled fee-for-service (utility) business models, the establishment of a service network, awareness raising campaigns on the benefits of clean cooking, female-focussed training programmes and bundling eCook systems with locally appropriate appliances to enable productive activities are seen as key to reaching scale.},

	abstract = {Whilst the rapid spread of solar photovoltaics (PV) across Africa has already transformed millions of lives, it has yet to have an impact on the main energy need of poor households: cooking. In the context of falling global PV prices, recent advancements in battery technology and rising charcoal/fuelwood prices in severely deforested regions, the door is opening for a potentially transformative alternative – solar electric cooking (PV-eCook). While initial investigations focused on solar home systems sized for cooking (cooking device, battery storage, charge controller and PV array), it has since been shown that battery-supported electric cooking (eCook) can also strengthen national, mini, micro and nano grids. This paper presents a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) based methodology, accounting for a wide variety of socio-cultural, political, technical and economic factors which are expected to affect the uptake and potential impact of eCook across a variety of African contexts. It shows the concept has considerable viability in many African countries, that there are significant sizeable markets (millions of potential users), and that within the next five years the anticipated costs of eCook are highly competitive against existing ‘commercialised polluting fuels’.},

	abstract = {The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city’s best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city’s digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation.},

	abstract = {Current approaches for understanding and influencing transport behaviour often involve creating fixed, homogenous groups of similar surveyed individuals in order to explore specific behavioural profiles, an approach known as segmentation. Most commonly, segmentation is not based on a formal statistical model, but either a simple ‘a priori’ defined group classification narrative, failing to capture the complexity of varying group characteristics, or a ‘post hoc’ heuristic cluster analysis, applied to multidimensional behavioural variables, creating complex descriptive group narratives. Here, we present an alternative, Bayesian finite mixture-modelling approach. A clear group narrative is created by constraining the Bayesian prior to group survey respondents based on the predominance of a single apposing transport behaviour, while a detailed insight into the behavioural complexity of each group is achieved using regression on multiple additional survey questions. Rather than assuming within group homogeneity, this creates a dynamic group structure, representing individual level probabilities of group membership and within group apposing travel behaviours. This approach also allows for numerical and graphical representation of the characteristics of these dynamic, clearly defined groups, providing detailed quantitative insight that would be unachievable using existing segmentation approaches. We present an application of this methodology to a large online commuting behaviour survey undertaken in the city of Exeter, UK. Survey respondents are grouped based on which transport mode type they predominantly commute by, and the key drivers of these predominant behaviours are modelled to inform the design of behavioural interventions to reduce commuter congestion in Exeter. Our approach allows us to prioritise the most effective intervention themes, and quantify their potential effect on motor vehicle usage. For example, we identify that individuals that predominantly commute by public transport, but also sometimes motor vehicle, do so on average up to one day per week less often, if they are strongly concerned about the environment, demonstrating how an intervention to promote environmental awareness could greatly reduce motor vehicle usage within this group.},

	abstract = {Using an expanded version of a psychological theory of attitude-behaviour relations, namely the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), scores on factor analysed multi-dimensional attitude statements were used to segment a population of day trip travellers into potential ‘mode switchers’ using cluster analysis. Six distinct psychographic groups were extracted, each with varying degrees of mode switching potential. Each group represents a unique combination of preferences, worldviews and attitudes, indicating that different groups need to be serviced in different ways to optimise the chance of influencing mode choice behaviour. Socio-demographic factors had little bearing on the travel profiles of the segments, suggesting that attitudes largely cut across personal characteristics. The evidence clearly shows that the same behaviour can take place for different reasons and that the same attitudes can lead to different behaviours. The paper asserts that commonly used a priori classifications used to segment populations based on demographic variables or simple behavioural measures may oversimplify the structure of the market. Cluster analysis is rarely used in studies of travel behaviour but this study demonstrates its utility in providing a way of extracting naturally occurring, relatively homogenous and meaningful groups to be used in designing targeted hard and ‘soft’ transport policies.},

Bottom-up engineering-based housing stock models can help to serve such a function. These models require calibrating, using micro-level energy measurements at the building level, to improve model accuracy; however, the only publicly available data for the UK housing stock is at the macro-level, at the district, urban, or national scale. This paper outlines a method for using macro-level data to calibrate micro-level models. A hierarchical framework is proposed, utilizing a combination of regression analysis and Bayesian inference. The result is a Bayesian regression method that generates estimates of the average energy use for different dwelling types whilst quantifying uncertainty in both the empirical data and the generated energy estimates. Finally, the Bayesian regression method is validated and the use of the hierarchical Bayesian calibration framework is demonstrated.},

Adding syntactic variables of space to these models would derive the effects of alternative layouts better and in more realistic ways. This article presents a generalized linear model that predicts the effect of different layouts of hospital units on nurses' movement patterns. Results from the model show that spatial properties of a nurse's assignment have a predictable impact on the frequency of trips that he or she makes to the patient rooms during a shift. The model is shown to have explanatory power and can be used to predict the movement patterns of nurses for units that are roughly similar in size and organizational process.},

Most clustering done in practice is based largely on heuristic but intuitively reasonable procedures, and most clustering methods available in commercial software are also of this type. However, there is little systematic guidance associated with these methods for solving important practical questions that arise in cluster analysis, such as how many clusters are there, which clustering method should be used, and how should outliers be handled. We review a general methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from medical diagnosis, minefield detection, cluster recovery from noisy data, and spatial density estimation. Finally, we mention limitations of the methodology and discuss recent developments in model-based clustering for non-Gaussian data, high-dimensional datasets, large datasets, and Bayesian estimation.},

	abstract = {Today, more and more bicycle sharing systems (BSSs) are being introduced in big cities. These transportation systems generate sizable transportation data, the mining of which can reveal the underlying urban phenomenon linked to city dynamics. This article presents a statistical model to automatically analyze the trip data of a bike sharing system. The proposed solution partitions (i.e., clusters) the stations according to their usage profiles. To do so, count series describing the stations’s usage through departure/arrival counts per hour throughout the day are built and analyzed. The model for processing these count series is based on Poisson mixtures and introduces a station scaling factor that handles the differences between the stations’s global usage. Differences between weekday and weekend usage are also taken into account. This model identifies the latent factors that shape the geography of trips, and the results may thus offer insights into the relationships between station neighborhood type (its amenities, its demographics, etc.) and the generated mobility patterns. In other words, the proposed method brings to light the different functions in different areas that induce specific patterns in BSS data. These potentials are demonstrated through an in-depth analysis of the results obtained on the Paris Vélib’ large-scale bike sharing system.},

These local, socio-technical experiments have been investigated by a trans-disciplinary team of researchers and practitioners in order to gain a deep understanding of the diversity of social and technical factors influencing the ways in which the systems work at different levels. This socio-technical research highlights the dynamics between technology and society and how they are mutually influencing and shaping each other. These dynamics create gradual changes in the socio-technical system of technical devises, people, practices, knowledge and other elements, requiring adjustments also by the implementing actors. A range of technical and non-technical factors at various levels are found to be relevant for the implementation, operation, sustenance and further development of the solar power supply systems. The research points to important factors that should be taken into account and considered when planning similar activities. In addition to the analysis of the research findings, the article includes a brief review of literature on the implementation and use of solar photovoltaic technology in developing countries, with an emphasis on solar mini-grid systems.},

However, the Green Deal proposals have the potential to generate financial risk, due to a possible overestimation of the energy savings arising from retrofit measures. This paper proposes a framework for handling the uncertainties associated with the prediction of these energy savings, as well as demonstrating how decisions can be made in the face of the uncertainties involved in the retrofit analysis of a housing stock. The proposed framework is applied to a case study set of dwellings and it is seen that a limited range of measures will be cost-effective under the Green Deal proposals for these dwellings; as a result, subsidies will be required if higher impact measures are to be considered viable. Finally, however, it is also seen that the monetary value of additional societal benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions and improved thermal comfort, is likely to more than outweigh the cost of any subsidies.},

The choices considered are for three main cooking fuels: firewood, kerosene, and LPG (liquid petroleum gas). The models, estimated using a large microeconomic dataset, show a reasonably good performance in the prediction of households’ primary and secondary fuel choices. This suggests that ordered models can be used to analyze multiple fuel use patterns in the Indian context. The results show that lack of sufficient income is one of the main factors that retard households from using cleaner fuels, which usually also require the purchase of relatively expensive equipments. The results also indicate that households are sensitive to LPG prices. In addition to income and price, several socio-demographic factors such as education and sex of the head of the household are also found to be important in determining household fuel choice.},

Although official estimates indicate that 85\% of Indian villages are electrified, fewer than 60\% of Indian households actually consume electricity. Until recently, the main policy has been to extend the grid to villages in rural areas in order to emphasise productive uses for agriculture. Today, there is a new emphasis on making sure rural households have access to and adopt electricity. This paper examines the factors that influence household electrification. The analysis shows that household electrification depends on household characteristics, the degree of community electrification, and the quality of electricity supply. Surprisingly, household expenditure and, in particular, the electricity tariff show only a relatively small effect on a household's choice for electricity.},

Since the underlying theory of consumer demand is based on the behaviour of individual agents, the use of micro data, which reflects individual and household behaviour, more closely, can shed greater light on the nature of consumer responses. In this paper, seasonal price and income elasticities of electricity demand in the residential sector of all urban areas of India are estimated for the first time using disaggregate level survey data for about 30,000 households. Three electricity demand functions have been econometrically estimated using monthly data for the winter, monsoon and summer season in order to understand the extent to which factors like income, prices, household size and other household specific characteristics, influence variations observed in individual households’ electricity demand. The results show electricity demand is income and price inelastic in all three seasons, and that household, demographic and geographical variables are significant in determining electricity demand.},

The low-income scenario makes it unique because the entire proposition is based on the importance of non-income drivers of appliance ownership that includes effects of changing the built environment (BE), household practices (HP) and appliances characteristics (AC). This study demonstrates quantitatively that non-income factors around energy practices influence appliance ownership, and therefore electricity consumption. The methodology consists of questionnaire design across the dimension of BE, HP and AC based on social practice theory, surveying of 1224 households and empirical analysis using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Results show that higher appliance ownership in the slum rehabilitation housing is due to change in household practice, built environment and affordability criteria of the appliances. Change in HP shifts necessary activities like cooking, washing and cleaning from outdoor to indoor spaces that positively and significantly influences higher appliance ownership. Poor BE conditions about indoor air quality, thermal comfort and hygiene; and product cost, discounts and ease of use of the appliances also triggers higher appliance ownership. The findings of this study can aid in designing better regulatory and energy efficiency policies for low-income settlements.},

The model also recognizes different population groups: i.e. urban and rural households, each distinguishing five income quintiles. The model is applied to analyze possible future developments of residential energy use in five developing world regions: India, China, South East Asia, South Africa and Brazil. We find that in each of these regions cooking is currently the main end-use function, but that other functions, such as space heating, cooling and appliances become more important. At the same time, energy consumption slowly shifts towards modern fuels. The model also shows that climate policy can reduce residential energy emissions, but could also slow down the energy transition away from traditional fuels in low income classes.},

	abstract = {Access to clean, affordable and appropriate energy is an important enabler of development. Energy allows households to meet their most basic subsistence needs; it is a central feature of all the millennium development goals (MDGs) and, while a lack of access to energy may not be a cause of poverty, addressing the energy needs of the impoverished lets them access services which in turn address the causes of poverty. While much is known about the factors affecting the decisions made when choosing between fuel types within a household, few quantitative studies have been carried out in South Africa to determine the extent to which these factors affect energy choice decisions. It is assumed that the factors traditionally included in economic demand such as price and income of the household affect choice; tastes and preferences as well as external factors such as distance to fuel suppliers are expected to influence preferences. This study follows two typical low-income rural sites in South Africa, Antioch and Garagapola, where the Electricity Basic Services Support Tariff (EBSST) was piloted in 2002. The EBSST is set at 50kWh/month per household for low domestic consumers; this is worth approximately R2011South African Rands. (±US\$3). This subsidy is a lifeline tariff, where households receive the set amount of units per month, free of charge irrespective of whether more units are purchased. These data (collected in 2001 and 2002), recently collated with detailed electricity consumption data, allow us to determine the drivers of electricity consumption within these households. The sample analysed is taken from the initial phase of the study, when no FBE had been introduced to the households. This enabled the study presented here to make use of the well-populated datasets to assess what affects the electricity use decision in these households. This paper attempts to assess which factors affected the decision-making process for electricity consumption within these households. A brief history of the electricity industry and the electrification is provided and the theoretical background for the electricity consumption model is provided. It was found that income, woodfuel usage, iron ownership and credit obtained were significant in determining consumption levels within these households. Price and cross-price elasticities were difficult to assess due to lack of data within the sample. The results have many possible implications for policy, including the effect that easily obtained credit has for low-income households.},

India’s electrified households on average still consume less than one-third of the world’s average for electricity. Rapid electrification, increasing incomes and technology development can result in increased appliance ownership and higher electricity use. A better understanding of this demand can help to develop effective energy-efficiency policies, optimize the addition of generation capacity, and tackle challenges of climate change and environmental pollution. However, research on residential electricity consumption has received limited attention in India until now. A systematic examination of determinants of residential electricity consumption will require an interdisciplinary approach involving the fields of engineering, economics (traditional and behavioural), anthropology, architecture and others. A two-step approach is presented to advance understanding. First, a critical literature review from different disciplines is presented that explores residential electricity consumption in India. Public data sets are also analyzed to gather insights and highlight inconsistencies. Second, an interdisciplinary approach is proposed and developed that can be adopted for research on residential electricity consumption in India. The data needs and systems to facilitate such an approach are provided.},

	abstract = {Understanding the factors that influence energy transitions at a household level, is essential for designing and implementing successful strategies to promote the uptake of cleaner fuels and deliver associated socio-economic benefits in the rapidly growing cities of the Global South. In India over 30 percent of urban households are still reliant on traditional fuels for some portion of their energy needs. Such fast-growing cities often display intra-urban inequalities of considerable magnitude which can condition individual access to resources and impact the effectiveness of energy provision strategies for individual city wards and districts. Intelligent use of data can play an important role in addressing this spatial inequality. Energy transitions are often conditioned by a complex interaction of economic and social factors. Analysis of targeted locally collected data in combination with secondary data sources can provide a means of identifying appropriate strategies and incentives for specific wards and communities that policy makers and planners can enact. In this paper we will use the results of a survey of 420 households in 7 city wards in Bangalore, India and show how this micro-scale survey data can be leveraged using a novel conceptual framework. The high resolution offered by the micro-scale dataset was used to identify 5 different clusters of households as a result of energy use patterns and associated non-income characteristics. These typologies may be used to inform policy makers, entrepreneurs, and engineers on the influence of non-income barriers to energy transition for different types of low-income communities.},

	abstract = {Energy efficiency is an important approach to mitigating climate change, minimizing energy system costs and improving system reliability. There is a role for the social sciences in these sorts of efforts to reduce energy waste. However, a singularly narrow theoretical and policy model of energy use and energy savings governs energy efficiency activities in the United States (and, to some degree, in Europe), as conducted by regulated utility companies and state actors. Firmly established in recent decades, an energy efficiency industry (EEI) is guided by this narrow model, which supplies a unifying conceptual frame, analytic paradigm and discursive context. That model is not hospitable to the social sciences and is extremely limited from a climate action point of view. The partial perspectives offered tend to misdirect attention and hamper the best efforts. This paper considers, in some detail, the organizational and regulatory systems that have given rise to, and sustain, this framework. It also offers a social science research agenda that might allow society to move beyond conventional thinking and the limitations of ineffective climate policy that follow from EEI business as usual.},

	abstract = {This paper seeks to address the gap in current studies of domestic energy-use in countries in the Global South from a socio-technical perspective. It explores a trajectory of domestic spatial layouts and accompanying household practices over the last century in Lahore, Pakistan. The research identifies various nexuses of practice-spatial arrangements of urban housing that have emerged, persisted and transformed over time, giving rise to unsustainable levels of electricity consumption in middle-class households. A mixed-method approach was adopted for collecting data including a review of archival documents, building regulations, house plans, case-studies, oral history narratives and expert interviews. This analysis reveals three key themes as central to explaining increasing household electricity demand: a shift from outdoor to indoor activities, transformation from inward- to outward-oriented design and a spatial dispersion of practices. The study suggests that understanding longitudinal dynamics of practice-arrangements can help identify and prevent normalisation of unsustainable configurations that gradually become embedded in social structures and practices. Contemporary standards are likely to prefigure higher demands for electricity because of increased consumption and specification of spaces, culturally ill-suited indoor and outdoor configurations, unquestioned reliance on electricity and neglected use of outdoor space. Though confined to a single case, this study has broader methodological applicability and implications for other countries in the Global South.},

	abstract = {Solar Home Systems (SHSs) and other off-grid solutions have shown promise in addressing the energy access gap for those with no or unreliable grid services. With that promise comes the expectation to boost socio-economic well-being of newly-connected households, who will continue climbing up the energy ladder. Despite the growing appreciation for the need to go beyond the techno-economics of energy access, and the recognition of the value of socio-technical systems perspective, the wider sociology of energy consumption and behaviour among adopters of off-grid solar solutions has been poorly explored. In this paper, we apply the Social Practice Theory (SPT) and the energy and solar energy ladder framework to analyse energy consumption and the changing social practices of SHSs users in Rwanda. We find that social practices change dynamically and depend on available appliances, whereas energy consumption follows a complex path but does not increase in a linear manner with time or more appliances. Insights can prove useful for public and private agencies working on off-grid electrification, offering a new perspective on the energy and solar energy ladder concepts while also showing the importance of social aspects of energy access even at relatively low levels of provision currently offered by SHSs.},

In our study the failure of the government policies to ensure reliable public services such as uninterrupted power supply and improving female education levels turn out to be the key stumbling blocks to raising household welfare in India. While a threshold level of household income is necessary for a purchase of a consumer durable, it is not a sufficient condition. Our results for the determinants of refrigerator ownership in India suggest that, even when households have sufficient purchasing power, the duration of a complementary good (electricity for {\textgreater}17 h per day) is critical for the ownership, all else held constant. Also, females in households tend to derive greater utility from the refrigerator usage due to its impact on lowering household burden of work and easing women’s entry into the labour market. Our results confirm the hypothesis that when women bargaining power is proxied by the level of education, households with a female with higher level of education have higher probability of refrigerator ownership.},

	abstract = {The version of practice theory developed by Theodore Schatzki is employed increasingly in energy consumption research. This emerged in response to problems Wittgenstein had identified in the core logic of prevailing rule-based, inter-subjectivist social theories of the late 20th century. Since then, however, the use and development of Schatzkian practice theory in energy studies has not been subjected to ongoing, robust philosophical critique. This paper offers some thoughts on how such a critique might proceed. It begins by outlining the roots of Schatzki’s version of practice theory in his critique of Giddens and Bourdieu. It then explores three areas where practice theory appears to need more in-depth critique and development: a fuller account of the ontological status of ‘practices’ and what this implies for research models; more clarity on lines of causality; and the place of socio-economic issues within practices and their descriptions. It concludes that practice theory provides a very insightful framework for heuristic models in energy research but that its usefulness is held back by these yet unresolved difficulties.},

Practitioners and policymakers largely perceive smart grids as technological interventions. However, a number of social, financial and governmental interventions can also make grids smart, i.e., more efficient, more responsive, more inclusive and more robust. Drawing on qualitative research done using elite interviews, site visits and document analysis of eight micro-grids in India, this paper provides concrete examples of what could be understood as social, financial and governmental smartness, and in doing so, broadens the knowledge on smart grids beyond the technical understanding. This paper argues that social, financial and governmental interventions are central to ‘smartness’, and that multifaceted and relational sociotechnical approaches will build cheaper, just, more democratic and sustainable smart grids. The paper observes that smart grids are not conceived as smart grids but rather develop incrementally. An incremental approach, rather than pushing a premeditated set of ideas and technologies, reduces adoption of non-contextual interventions as well as unnecessary investments in new technologies. The paper recommends that policymakers and practitioners should understand and develop smart grids as sociotechnical and incremental grids.},

Most of the available studies for the South Asia region and particularly for India had mainly focused on the access aspect of clean cooking in terms of fuel or stove. In this study, we particularly focus on the household transition to clean cooking fuel (LPG) in terms of its usage. Using the Tobit regression model for censored data the study highlights the socioeconomic and other factors that may influence LPG transition. The study finds that there could be common as well as location specific factors driving LPG transition. Income linkages with LPG usage may be weak in regions with high prevalence of home produced or collected solid fuel consumption. Duration of LPG acquisition, considered in the study as a factor of behavioural aspect, has emerged as an important variable promoting LPG transition over time. The analysis suggests that LPG capital subsidy scheme, PMUY, has provided a trigger for LPG transition among beneficiary households. Increasing the share of LPG in monthly cooking fuel may require good LPG services such as doorstep delivery.},

For school-going children in these households, this challenge has contributed to issues such as difficulty in studying after dark, reduced performance in schools, increased dropout from school due to poor educational outcomes, and exposure to pernicious emissions from predominantly kerosene-burning wick lamps. Use of off-grid solar lamps in these poor households has the potential to address these challenges. There is limited research investigating the impact of solar lamps on school going children in rural India. We analyzed the data collected from the Million Solar Urja Lamp Program (MSP) implemented in four states of India. The survey of 873 rural poor households in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Odisha utilized a purposive random sampling method to reveal that the use of solar lamps increased total study time (TST) per day during dark hours from 88 to 118 min in the impact period. Furthermore, enhancement in study time was found more for girls (32 min/day) than boys (27 min/day). Total kerosene expenditures in these households decreased from 0.94 US\$ to 0.67 US\$ per month while total electricity expenditures dropped from 3.7 US\$ to 3.5 US\$ per month. The findings shows that number of rooms, household head's education, and the child's class have a positive and significant influence on TST in dark hours at home. A notable observation was that the use of kerosene-burning lighting during the impact period shows a negative correlation with TST in dark hours as compared to baseline period due to the adoption of solar study lamps. The results also show that with increment in studying time, a large number of children moved from lower study time group to moderate and higher study time group.},

	abstract = {The current study examines the effect of a set of Electricity Act, adopted by India in 2003, on the price gap between two specific consumer groups-industrial and commercial. Paying a higher tariff than the other consumer groups, these two groups have been referred to as the ‘subsidizing’ groups of consumers in the Indian context. While the effect of reforms between the ‘subsidizing; ’ and subsidized’ groups has received attention, research on the effect of reforms on the tariff gap within the ‘subsidizing’ sector has been under-addressed. Using data on all major states of the country spanning from 2004-2014, the study uses a graphical exposition, excerpts of policy document and panel econometric modelling technique. The study focuses on six aspects of the policy and emphasizes on adoption and implementation extent and finds that mere policy adoption has no strong effect on tariff gap. Instead, effective implementation may be beneficial in narrowing the tariff gap within the subsidizing sectors as well. Specifically, unbundling of the electricity sector into three different segments and establishment of an independent regulatory authority in the state may lead to narrowing tariff gap if implemented effectively.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the energy consumption behaviour of primary school children in a low-income community in South Africa, an area of enquiry that has received little attention to date. The study uses a mixed-methods approach comprising a survey, energy diaries and a focus group. The paper provides insights into how children’s energy behaviours are shaped by geographical and contextual factors such as the socio-economic situation of the family and social practices, as well as accessibility of fuel sources and appliances in specific areas. The main behaviours performed by children are lighting, cooking, heating, charging of electronic devices, and the use of applications inside the home for entertainment and communication purposes. Although some of these behaviours are documented, we identified important differences with existing studies relating to cooking and heating behaviours: the children in this study used a range of modern and more traditional/transitional fuels shaped by household energy access and affordability. Furthermore, the children in this study demonstrated increased autonomy in using appliances and fuels and engaged in household tasks such as independent cooking and family care in comparison with existing studies. The paper concludes by identifying areas for future studies to ensure children’s energy needs and practices are better integrated into energy interventions, planning and decision-making, all factors key to shaping long-term sustainable energy futures.},

Every day, more than a billion people around the world must answer these questions.{\textless}em{\textgreater}Portfolios of the Poor{\textless}/em{\textgreater}is the first book to systematically explain how the poor find solutions to their everyday financial problems.  The authors conducted year-long interviews with impoverished villagers and slum dwellers in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa--records that track penny by penny how specific households manage their money. The stories of these families are often surprising and inspiring. Most poor households do not live hand to mouth, spending what they earn in a desperate bid to keep afloat. Instead, they employ financial tools, many linked to informal networks and family ties. They push money into savings for reserves, squeeze money out of creditors whenever possible, run sophisticated savings clubs, and use microfinancing wherever available. Their experiences reveal new methods to fight poverty and ways to envision the next generation of banks for the "bottom billion."  Indispensable for those in development studies, economics, and microfinance,{\textless}em{\textgreater}Portfolios of the Poor{\textless}/em{\textgreater}will appeal to anyone interested in knowing more about poverty and what can be done about it.},

	abstract = {Over the next 25 to 30 years, nearly all of the growth in energy demand, fossil fuel use, associated local pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions is forecast to come from the developing world. This paper argues that the world's poor and near-poor will play a major role in driving medium-run growth in energy consumption. As the world economy expands and poor households' incomes rise, they are likely to get connected to the electricity grid, gain access to good roads, and purchase energy-using assets like appliances and vehicles for the first time. We argue that the current forecasts for energy demand in the developing world may be understated because they do not accurately capture growth in demand along the extensive margin, as low-income households buy their first durable appliances and vehicles. Within a country, the adoption of energy-using assets typically follows an S-shaped pattern: among the very poor, we see little increase in the number of households owning refrigerators, vehicles, air conditioners, and other assets as incomes go up; above a first threshold income level, we see rapid increases of ownership with income; and above a second threshold, increases in ownership level off. A large share of the world's population has yet to go through the first transition, suggesting there is likely to be a large increase in the demand for energy in the coming years.},

	abstract = {There are two ways of managing market price risk in electricity day ahead markets, forecasting and hedging. In emerging markets, since hedging possibilities are limited, forecasting becomes the foremost important tool to manage spot price risk. Despite the existence of great diversity of spot price forecasting methods, due to the unique characteristics of electricity as a commodity, there are still three key forecasting challenges that a market participant has to take into account: risk of selection of an inadequate forecasting method and transparency level of the market (availability level of public data) and country-specific multi-seasonality factors. We address these challenges by using a detailed market-level data from the Turkish electricity day-ahead auctions, which is an interesting research setting in that it presents a number of challenges for forecasting. We reveal the key distinguishing features of this market quantitatively which then allow us to propose individual and ensemble forecasting models that are particularly well suited to it. This forecasting study is pioneering for Turkey as it is the very first to focus specifically on electricity spot prices since the country's day-ahead market was established in 2012. We also suggested applicable policy and managerial implications for both regulatory bodies, market makers and participants.},

This paper introduces a narrative-informed exploratory approach for analysing future energy transition pathways under these uncertainty conditions. In this approach, exploratory modelling is used to explore the impact of various uncertainties, such as potential installed capacity and supporting policies for different energy options, on the unfolding of transition pathways. The approach produces several sets of scenarios. We complement this quantitative exploration of the future with narratives (storylines) generated based on the concepts in the sustainability transitions field. Narratives are used (i) as a supporting framework for model structure; (ii) to guide the exploration of the future; and (iii) to interpret the ensemble of quantitative scenarios. We describe how synergies between narratives and exploratory modelling inform both the framed and open-ended exploration of future transition pathways. The approach is demonstrated with a case study of the transition in India's electricity sector. We show that the realisation of the 100GW solar electricity target by 2022 is unlikely, and that the development of solar electricity is highly dependent on the active role of government.},

The data-mining and supervised based machine learning models include; regression support vector machine, Gaussian process regression, scaled conjugate gradient, tree bagger, boosted tree, bagged tree, neural network, multiple linear regression and bayesian regularization. The external climate data, hours/day in a week, previous week load, previous day load and previous 24-h average load are applied as input parameters for these models. Whereas, the output of the models is the electrical power required for water source heat pump. A water source heat pump located in Beijing, China, is selected for examining 1-month ahead cooling load forecasting, i.e., from July 8 to August 7, 2016. In this paper, simulations are classified into three sessions: 7-days, 14-days and 1-month. The forecast performance is assessed by computing four performance indices such as mean square error, mean absolute error, root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error. The mean absolute percentage error for 7-days ahead cooling load prediction of the water source heat pump from data-mining based models, Gaussian process regression, tree bagger, boosted tree, bagged tree and multiple linear regression were 0.405\%, 3.544\%, 1.928\%, 1.703\% and 13.053\% respectively. While, mean absolute percentage error of 7-days ahead forecasting in case of machine learning based models such as a regression support vector machine, Bayesian regularization, scaled conjugate gradient and neural network were 12.761\%, 2.314\%, 6.314\%, 2.592\% respectively. The percentage forecasting error index proved that the results of data-mining based models are more precise and similar to the existing machine learning models. The results also demonstrate that the better performance and efficiency in foreseeing the abnormal behaviour in forecasting and future cooling load demand in the building environment.},

The increasing presence of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in commercial buildings has resulted in a rising availability of high frequency interval data. These data can be used for a variety of energy efficiency applications such as demand response, fault detection and diagnosis, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) optimization. This large amount of data has also opened the door to the use of advanced statistical learning models, which hold promise for providing accurate building baseline energy consumption predictions, and thus accurate saving estimations. The gradient boosting machine is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is gaining considerable traction in a wide range of data driven applications, such as ecology, computer vision, and biology. In the present work an energy consumption baseline modeling method based on a gradient boosting machine was proposed. To assess the performance of this method, a recently published testing procedure was used on a large dataset of 410 commercial buildings. The model training periods were varied and several prediction accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the model’s performance. The results show that using the gradient boosting machine model improved the R‐squared prediction accuracy and the CV(RMSE) in more than 80 percent of the cases, when compared to an industry best practice model that is based on piecewise linear regression, and to a random forest algorithm.},

The hype and the fuzziness that can characterise its use conceals a bright promise for research: the possibility of opening up new research perspectives, of finding new answers, but also of raising new questions. In this article, we explore interdisciplinarity in energy research through seven questions (corresponding to seven sections): “what does it mean?”, “why?”, “who’s involved?”, “how?”, “what?”, “what barriers?”, and “what prospects?” In the “what does it mean?” section, we will try to illustrate the “degrees of interdisciplinarity” in energy research by means of definitions emanating from recent work. The “why” question focuses on the main benefits of interdisciplinarity, while “who’s involved?” raises the issue of “by whom and with whom”. The “how” section essentially looks at methods and frameworks. The “what” question introduces the main topics of interdisciplinary energy research, presenting the papers that make up this special issue. “What barriers?” and “what prospects?” conclude the paper with an attempt to identify the new research paths that are beginning to emerge.},

	abstract = {Reliable, secure, and affordable energy services are essential to ensuring sustainable economic and social development in the rapidly growing cities of the Global South, yet in India over 30 percent of urban households are still reliant on traditional fuels such as biomass and kerosene for some portion of their energy needs. Understanding the factors that influence energy transitions at a household level, is essential for successful strategies to promote the uptake of cleaner fuels and deliver associated socio-economic benefits. Such fast-growing cities often display intra-urban inequalities of considerable magnitude which can condition individual access to resources and impact the effectiveness of energy provision strategies for individual city districts. In this paper we will use the results of a survey of 500 households in Bangalore, India and explore how this data compares with the ‘wave concept’ model of energy transition. This ‘wave concept’ view of energy transitions focuses on appliance ownership as a proxy for energy services and conceptualises the uptake of appliances as a wave with early and late adopters rather than an income-based step change, and as a result better accounts for the role of non-income factors. The wards targeted by the survey cover a range of low-income ward typologies characterised by factors including income, livelihoods, building construction, socio-cultural factors, access to fuels, and reliability of supply. Validating an appropriate model for the uptake of new energy technologies and fuels in households, can better inform policy makers, entrepreneurs, and engineers on the influence of non-income barriers to energy transition across different districts of a city. By understanding how households use energy, and what limits the adoption of more efficient technologies at a local level, city planners and engineers can develop targeted sustainable strategies for adoption of cleaner more efficient fuels and appliances in households.},

Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration., Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision–analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions., We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n=544 for model development, n=273 for external validation)., We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for making clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.},

	abstract = {The aim of achieving stable economic growth and development deter the pathways of being a low carbon society in developing countries. Nonetheless, it is imperative to understand and analyze the long-term goals of such societies to upgrade and redirect priorities towards the low-carbon structure. Therefore, this study is carried by applying a novel multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach and the Bilan Carbone model to examine the different possibilities for cost/benefit analysis from direct reductions in carbon emission levels in the Lahore Metropolitan Area (LMA) of Pakistan. The LMA is a metropolitan city in the developing country and is marked with a huge spike in energy demands and carbon emissions due to increasing population. Three scenarios including one current (2010), and two future (business as usual—2050BaU and low carbon scenario—2050LCS), were developed. Our findings show no evidence of renewable energy use—such as solar, wind, and biomass—in the current energy mix of LMA. Furthermore, an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from 3.5 in 2010 to 14 million tonnes (mt) in 2050 is found. Mitigation potential analysis of different sectors showed that the industrial sector of the city has the biggest mitigation capacity (13\%) until the year 2050, whereas, the smallest proportion may come from the commercial sector (4\%). The carbon emissions in LMA would be reduced as much as 50\% as compared to the BaU scenario until 2050. Moreover, this mitigation potential study would also serve as a ripple effect in the data deficient cities of low-income countries.},

	abstract = {As a result of urbanisation and climate change, many cities experience the necessity of efficient and sustainable land use. Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are interventions that address social, economic and environmental sustainability issues simultaneously, thereby presenting a multifunctional, solution-oriented approach to increasing urban sustainability. As elements of the emerging NBS concept resemble related, existing approaches to urban greening, this review assesses the implications of this concept for discourse and practice in urban greening. The paper identifies key NBS principles and compares them with those of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA) and Green Infrastructure (GI). Key differences emerge: the NBS concept incorporates a broader array of interventions and a broader range of perspectives on what qualifies as ‘nature-based’, and it is most explicitly oriented towards providing solutions to complex challenges. NBS implementation could therefore benefit from a more performance-based planning approach; a flexible approach to urban planning which accommodates the integration of multiple land uses and considers urban complexity. We conclude that the NBS concept has potential to unite currently segregated bodies of knowledge generated as part of related approaches to urban greening, and can enable researchers and policymakers to more explicitly discuss the role of nature in addressing a broad range of sustainability challenges.},

	abstract = {Governments around the world are trying to find viable solutions for reducing carbon emissions and pollution, one of the primary sources of which is domestic household consumption. Although Qatar is rich in fossil fuel energy resources, there is a strategic drive towards sustainability to decrease energy consumption overall whilst increasing the nation’s dependence on clean and renewable energy. One of the areas to enhance sustainability is through reducing and managing the energy demands and habits of domestic users. This research examines the current energy use in Qatar with a view to making recommendations in regard to challenging and improving consumer behaviour in respect to energy efficiency. A mixed methods approach was untaken consisting of both qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data was gathered from a wide spread survey of n = 410 Qatari based consumers in regard to their energy consumption behaviour, investigating avenues for enabling sustainable behaviour change. The qualitative data was been collected by interviewing a panel of energy experts in Qatar. The purpose of this research study is to gain valuable insight into Qatari resident’s energy consumption behaviour and perception of renewable energy and sustainability. The results will help to identify solutions to Qatar’s high consumption of electricity per capita. This study has further implications amongst similar nations and states to address energy consumptions where there is a natural abundance of fossil fuel energy resources. This study has found that user’s education and awareness of the environmental impact is dependent on efficient energy monitoring and usage. However, due to the presence of energy subsidies in Qatar, citizens are not inclined to modify their energy consumption behaviour through economic means. This suggests that a greater awareness of the effects of excessive energy use is required through sustainability education to motivate behaviour change. The results of this study were analysed using self-determination and hierarchal needs theories, indicating that education and public engagement and awareness are the best options for domestic energy conservation in Qatar.},

Household attributes and characteristics of existing appliances stock, such as, appliance type, capacity, wattage, energy star rating, etc. were assessed from the questionnaire survey. Suitable retrofit alternatives for the most energy inefficient appliances as observed in the survey have been analysed. For the retrofit alternatives, efficiency standards were taken from the schedules developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, a subsidiary to Ministry of Power, Government of India. Further, life cycle cost analysis was performed for 6 categories of appliances (air conditioner, refrigerator, light, fan and television). Cost effectiveness of the retrofitted energy efficient solution was estimated based on the cost of conserved electricity. The technical and economic analysis reveals that by retrofitting these appliances, 8 GW h electricity per annum can be saved that can result in a consequential reduction of 6.6 megaton of CO2 per annum.},

In this framework, the IEA EBC Annex 67 introduces the concept of ‘Energy Flexible Building’, defined as a building able to manage its demand and generation in accordance with local climate conditions, user needs and grid requirements. Currently, there is no insight into how much flexibility a building may offer, and this study aims to overview the theoretical approaches and existing indicators to evaluate the Energy Flexibility of building clusters. The focus on cluster scale allows for the exploitation of the variation in energy consumption patterns between different types of buildings and the coordination of load shifting for the improvement of renewable energy use. The reviewed indicators can contribute to the definition of the Smart Readiness Indicator, introduced in the European Commission proposal for the EPBD revision, in order to test a building’s technological readiness to adapt to the needs of the occupants and the energy environment, as well as to operate more efficiently.},

Usually, utility companies motivate residential consumers to participate in household demand side management (DSM) techniques. The residential consumers’ main intention is to reduce their electricity bills whereas utilities’ primary goal is to reduce their system peak load demand. The benefits of DSM can be enhanced with smart energy storage systems. In this paper, an intelligent multi-objective household DSM with battery storage systems is proposed to minimize both the objectives simultaneously. Generally, the residential DSM deals with various controllable appliances that normally have different operating time priorities according to the consumers’ preferences. Because of this, the DSM problem is modelled as a mixed integer optimization problem. In this paper, the multi-objective mixed integer linear programming technique (MOMILP) is used to solve the proposed residential DSM problem. The proposed model is tested on a system having four different residential consumers. The benefits of the battery energy storage systems are analysed by taking six different scenarios. An economic analysis of each residential consumer's battery storage system with load uncertainty modelling is also done in this paper. Simulation results of various scenarios with different objectives demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Both are important for the human sustenance over long term. The alternate sources of energy particularly renewable sources are being developed and boosted to support the existing production of energy for use. However, the 100\% reliability or switching to a total renewable resource may some time required to be supported by strong measures. Looking into the present context the importance of efficient utilization of energy is seen as a strong and possible fit is managing the problem of increase of energy consumption. The challenges arising in the path of energy conservation or energy efficiency are many. A lot of research work is carried on the different individual factors which are hindering the progress of energy efficiency measures. Also a lot of measures have been suggested by different researchers from time to time. All these barriers and measures are either not organized in proper manner or are highly localized. A very meager attempt is made to study these barriers in a holistic manner. Some researchers have highlighted the role of sustainability in the development of energy. The relationship between the increase in demand of energy and economic development of a country is beyond challenge. For a developing country like India, where there is a big mismatch between energy supply and energy demand, and further challenge to keep this gap low due to rapid development, industrialization and urbanization. Energy Efficiency then becomes a very useful tool to overcome the challenges in supplying energy to all. Energy demand can be only be reduced and cannot be eliminated completely. The optimum level to which the energy consumption can be reduced is the indicator of energy efficiency. This term Energy Efficiency is affected in practice by lot of challenges which are making highly dynamic in nature. Therefore,it calls for a detailed and comprehensive approach in identification and listing of different factors governing energy efficiency in buildings in Indian context. Again only identification of barriers is not sufficient. A system needs to be adopted how these challenges or barriers can be addressed, for that some latest tools for ranking of these identified barriers needs to be adopted. Best-Worst multi-criteria decision making is used to rank the barriers. Results show economic, governmental and technological barriers as most prominent barriers among all. The results shall be of great help in decision making for effecting the improvement and development of energy efficiency measures in buildings. With the help of decision makers a roadmap is developed to help overcome these barriers over long, medium and short term respectively.},

This demands development of new set of comfort models based on local environmental parameters, socio-cultural setup and behavioural action. Analysis shows that four major variables like indoor and outdoor temperature, relative humidity and clothing pattern plays an important role in defining comfort and greatly influence the occupant's perception and acceptance on thermal comfort. In this study, comfort models are developed based on these variables. The computed neutral temperatures based on the models are compared with the comfort temperatures obtained through comfort survey. The models are developed using the measured data of January and July months and validated with the measured data of April and October months. This study also concludes that it is not possible to obtain a generalized thermal comfort model for all climatic zone because adaptation process, expectation and perception of people are region specific and governed by local socio-cultural requirement.},

Diurnal ranges of temperature (DTR) showed wide variation in each of months included in this study. Higher DTR were experienced in the month of May for all the stations – rural as well as the urban. As the summer progressed, the DTR showed declining trend through the months of June to August and started rising again in September showing the influence of monsoon in air temperature regime. Variation in the average monthly DTR within the season is low in urban stations compared to rural ones.

The observed results showed that the central portion of the city exhibited the highest surface temperature compared to the surrounding open area, the areas having dense built-up displayed higher temperatures and the areas covered by vegetation and water bodies exhibited lower temperatures. Strong correlation is observed between Land surface temperatures with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and UTFVI. The observed LST of the area also validated trough the Google Earth Images. Ecological evaluation of the area also showed that the city has worst ecological index in the highly urbanized area in the central portion of the city. The present study provides very scientific information on impact of urbanization and anthropogenic activities which cause major changes on eco-environment of the city.},

	abstract = {Solid biomass fuel use is closely intertwined with the life of rural households in Asia. However, its consumption and demand vary significantly across different countries, states and in various agro-climatic zones. Uses of solid biomass fuel in the kitchen not only leads to household air pollution but also influences the air quality in the regions of Indo- Gangetic plains. Considering this, current study assesses the household fuel use pattern and trend in India. Further, the socio-cultural, economical and behavioral factors which can influence the household fuel choice were evaluated through a case study from Punjab, India using a standard questionnaire. The decadal trend in household energy consumption pattern shows that 77.5\% of rural households in India rely on solid biomass fuel for cooking. Further, during the last 30 years (upto 2011), only 2\% of rural households shifted from solid biomass fuel to cleaner fuels. However, after 2011 data shows significant uptake of the cleaner fuels for the household cooking purposes. Results of the case study show that rural households depend on numerous approaches rather than relying on a particular source of household energy. This contradicts the energy ladder hypothesis of improvement in energy source with an increase in income. Cooking fuel preferences were found to be significantly determined by socio-economic and cultural factors. Thus, providing improved cookstoves or cleaner fuels are not sufficient to attain their sustained use. Hence, the current study highlights the need for effective user-behavior focused interventions to enhance the transition towards cleaner fuel for household energy.},

	abstract = {Economic poverty is a dominant factor in inducing energy poverty in millions of households in India. This study uses primary data on various socio-economic variables (SEVs) collected from 1,000 households in Mumbai, equally divided into four income groups. The SEVs of the households used in the empirical analysis include their expenses on electricity services, consumption expenditure, dwelling size, education level, and awareness of - energy and environment. The results of the study show that energy poverty mainly depends on the consumption expenditure of a household, and it varies across four income groups. Increase in the dwelling size of households of low- and very low income groups also increases their expenses on electricity and, hence, their energy poverty. Although the education level of households does not have any significant effect on their energy poverty, their awareness of energy conservation measures is linked to reduction in energy poverty, particularly in households having lower income. The study suggests that achieving sustainable energy for all households in India requires policies and strategies to improve access, availability and affordability of electricity and increased awareness of the masses on energy conservation.},

This paper analyses greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to energy consumption in the domestic sector considering household activities and socioeconomic parameters. A stratified random survey of 1967 households in Bangalore pertaining to the energy consumption reveals that annual per capita electricity consumption ranges from 9.64 to 2337kWh/year with an average of 336±267kWh/year. Emission from most of the wards (66 wards) is about 10–15Gg/year, while wards in peri-urban areas emit less than 10Gg/year. Extrapolation of these, show that total carbon dioxide from all wards of Greater Bangalore accounts to 3350Gg/Year. The energy consumption analyses reveal a proportional increase in the per capita energy consumption with the family income suggesting that economic levels in respective wards is an important parameter in the domestic energy consumption and also GHG emissions. Suggested interventions through large scale penetration of renewable sources of energy and energy conservation would help in reducing greenhouse gases and consequent warming of the Earth.},

However, it has been much less successful at reconciling the innumerable inconsistencies and contradictions among these competing explanations, a situation that has not been resolved by recent advances in ‘computational social science’. In this Perspective, I argue that this ‘incoherency problem’ has been perpetuated by an historical emphasis in social science on the advancement of theories over the solution of practical problems. I argue that one way for social science to make progress is to adopt a more solution-oriented approach, starting first with a practical problem and then asking what theories (and methods) must be brought to bear to solve it. Finally, I conclude with a few suggestions regarding the sort of problems on which progress might be made and how we might organize ourselves to solve them.},

An inductive theory-building approach was adopted to explore this and advance current knowledge in the boundaries of social entrepreneurship and policy. We propose ‘Engagement’ and ‘Disengagement’ as the two strategies used by social enterprises in this context in accessing government support and policy. ‘Engagement’ is a strategy comprising of the tactics: (a) Leveraging Policy, (b) Building and Leveraging Relationships, (c) Lobbying, and (d) Monitoring. ‘Disengagement’ is a strategy comprising of the tactics: (a) Avoiding Government Presence, and (b) Disengagement from Policy.},

Forty-six papers on the outcome of these social intervention were reviewed and categorized in this article based on the major strategies applied in anticipation of behaviour change. This paper shares information on the techniques used for the interventions, to what degree each intervention was successful or not and why it was adjudged successful or otherwise. It further explores some of the problems associated with the interventions and their reporting, followed by suggestions on how study practices can be improved. The techniques discussed include the use energy labels, energy performance certificates, energy auditing, prompts, norm appeals, commitments, economic incentives and disincentives, feedbacks, community-based initiatives, benchmarking, goal setting and gamification. Feedbacks, gamification, goal setting and community-based initiatives proved to be the most effective as they all recorded average energy savings of above 20\%.

	abstract = {The concept of energy literacy is increasingly receiving more research attention within the fields of education, economics and psychology. A wide variety of definitions and approaches characterise the energy literacy literature, making comparisons and generalizability of the findings problematic. This paper aims to review and organise the energy literacy literate that focus on the understanding of domestic electricity and gas use, by providing a framework for categorisation of the different conceptual and methodological approaches. Four types of household energy literacy are distinguished based on the existing literature: 1) device energy literacy, 2) action energy literacy, 3) financial energy literacy and 4) multifaceted energy literacy. The literature on each type of energy literacy is critically reviewed, focusing on the level of household energy literacy, its predictors and its relation to energy use. We call for more common principles and measures within the energy literacy research to allow for direct comparisons and longitudinal research on household energy literacy. This would greatly improve the quality and impact of the research, which in turn will help policy makers to decide how to address (which type of) energy literacy to facilitate domestic energy conservation.},

	abstract = {Energy justice is an emerging concept that informs policymakers on the just distribution of, and access to energy services. However, research on how policy grounded in energy justice may facilitate greater intergenerational equity is few and far between. Additionally, energy justice as a decision-making framework has mostly been based in western thought, through its application in developed country contexts. The value of non-Western philosophies in advancing the energy justice literature has received little attention. In this paper, we address these gaps by drawing upon Amartya Sen’s interpretation of the Hindu Bhagavad Gita, using this to conceptualise a temporal energy justice decision-making framework that builds on the Gita’s time-based notions of ‘duty-focused’ and ‘consequence-sensitive’ decision outcomes. We apply this framework to study India’s energy landscape and underlying tensions, largely emanating from a steadfast policy focus on alleviating energy poverty in the short-term whilst also committing to a low carbon energy transition for the future. We advocate for the need to move beyond this dichotomous focus on duty versus consequence, and pursue a policy position reflected in the understanding of realised justice – an inclusive and comprehensive account of just outcomes from both an intra- and inter-generational perspective.},

We analyze the business model for one mode of decentralization—microgrids—and quantify the economics for self-supply of electricity and thermal energy and explicitly resolve technological as well as policy variables. We offer a tool, based on the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) modeling framework, that determines the cost-minimal capacity and operation of distributed energy resources in a microgrid, and apply it in southern California to three “iconic” microgrid types which represent typical commercial adopters: a large commercial building, critical infrastructure, and campus. We find that optimal investment leads to some deployment of renewables but that natural gas technologies underpin the most robust business cases—due in part to relatively cheap gas and high electricity rates. This finding contrasts sharply with most policy advocacy, which has focused on the potentials for decentralization of the grid to encourage deployment of renewables. Decentralization could radically reduce customer energy costs, but without the right policy framework it could create large numbers of small decentralized sources of gas-based carbon emissions that will be difficult to control if policy makers want to achieve deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.},

To dig deeper into the problem at the micro level and to deliberate the policy implications, we developed detailed village-level case studies and analysed region-specific energy poverty.

The way in which the country shapes its energy policy not only affects India itself, but also the global climate action. On the one hand, India led by PM Narendra Modi declares the commitment to pro-climate actions, including the enhancement of the energy efficiency and renewable capacity. On the other hand, the development of India's conventional energy sector (coal) was indicated as one of the reasons for the US′ exit from the Paris Agreement. This dilemma lead to a discussion on the shape of India's energy policy, seen from the climate's standpoint. In this context, the article discusses the pillars of India's energy policy presented by Modi in 2016. The main energy pillars (access, efficiency, sustainability and security) are juxtaposed with the previous Indian strategic documents concerning the energy sector, including electricity (National Electricity Policy of 2005, Draft National Energy Policy of 2017). A climate-energy policy analysis is extended by legal comments on Indian energy law. As a result, the article draws a picture of India's energy policy and climate agenda in ‘black’ (conventional energy) and ‘green’ (renewable capacity) colours.},

There are three principal findings: (i) fuel costs are a critical obstacle to widespread adoption, (ii) fuel stacking is the prevailing norm as few households stop using firewood when adopting LPG, and (iii) both users and non-users have highly positive views of LPG as a convenient and clean cooking fuel. These findings show that expanding LPG use offers great promise in rural India, but affordability prevents a complete transition from traditional biomass to clean cooking fuels.},

This paper estimates fuel costs associated with such transitions and analyses the determinants of access to electricity for lighting and Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) for cooking. State-level regression models based on data from 61st (2004–05), 68th (2011–12) and 71st (2014) rounds of National Sample Survey are used. While energy expenditures are found to be comparable for kerosene and electricity for lighting, it increases 3.6–8.8-fold for transition to LPG from traditional fuel. Availability is important for greater uptake of electricity i.e. higher rate of electrification helps, but the same is not true for LPG. While untargeted tariff-subsidy leads to significant budgetary pressure, it doesn't affect the access. States with higher income and literacy rate/women empowerment have greater access to LPG and electricity. This shows while Indian energy policies always focused on removal of supply-side barriers through infrastructure creation, removal of first cost barrier and subsidizing tariff, a more meaningful way to ensure access is perhaps to integrate energy policies within the broader arena of comprehensive development policies to ensure improvement in socio-economic indicators.},

In a survey experiment with 3208 villagers from six major states of northern India, we examine the social acceptance of off-grid solar power as an alternative to grid extension. By randomly assigning different frames about this energy technology to the villagers, we study how concerns about the cost of sustainable energy, inequality of energy access, and the role of private business and the state shape individuals’ acceptance of off-grid solar power. We find that concerns about the role of private business and possible increases in rural-urban inequality are salient among the rural population. The rural population is concerned about (i) exploitative businesses practices and (ii) the inequality that solar power in villages is more expensive than conventional grid power in urban areas. These findings show that the social acceptance of new, sustainable energy technologies cannot be taken for granted in rural development and offer insights into the salience of different varieties of concerns.},

This approach is first of its kind for analysis of a national level energy policy. The system uses mixed integer linear programming approach to mathematically formulate the policy using input parameters, decision variables and their relationships. The DSS requires input parameters namely distributing capacity of a LPG dealer, subsidised cylinders available per connection, number of households, and LPG penetration required. We have analysed different scenarios varying the input parameters mentioned. The decision support system has deterministically found the number of dealers required and LPG penetration in a region projecting both BPL and aggregate household coverage. The system helps in making sound decisions based on quantitative modelling ensuring optimal implementation of the policy. This kind of decision support system can be formulated for various policies to make sound decisions based on strong quantitative evidences.},

The objective is to determine if the energy poor are also income poor and whether and how energy policies help reduce energy poverty, independent of income. The findings suggest that in rural areas some 57\% of households are energy poor, versus 22\% that are income poor. But in urban areas the energy poverty rate is 28\% compared to 20\% that are income poor. That is, energy policies are expected to play some roles in mitigating energy poverty. We find that reducing energy poverty requires not only support for rural electrification, but also more use of modern cooking fuels such as LPG.

All the data used in this pamphlet comes from the respective official source: for electrification, the World Bank; for clean fuels and technologies for cooking, the World Health Organization (WHO); for renewable energy, the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA); and for energy efficiency, the IEA and UNSD. All projections are from the IEA’s World Energy Outlook. This report identifies best practices that have proven successful in recent years, as well as key approaches that policy makers may deploy in coming years. Recommendations applicable to all SDG 7 targets include recognizing the importance of political commitment and long-term energy planning, stepping up private financing, and supplying adequate incentives for the deployment of clean technology options. The following sections review progress in electricity access, access to clean cooking solutions, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. The Energy Progress Report reviews progress to 2017 for energy access and to 2016 for renewable energy and energy efficiency, against a baseline year of 2010.

Off-grid solar technologies hold potential as an affordable and clean solution to satisfy basic electricity needs. We conducted a randomized field experiment in India to estimate the causal effect of off-grid solar power on electricity access and broader socioeconomic development of 1281 rural households. Within a year, electrification rates in the treatment group increased by 29 to 36 percentage points. Daily hours of access to electricity increased only by 0.99 to 1.42 hours, and the confidence intervals are wide. Kerosene expenditure on the black market decreased by 47 to 49 rupees per month. Despite these strong electrification and expenditure effects, we found no systematic evidence for changes in savings, spending, business creation, time spent working or studying, or other broader indicators of socioeconomic development.
Basic solar microgrids can significantly improve access to electricity in an affordable manner, but they generate few socioeconomic benefits.

	abstract = {Kerosene subsidies intended for Indian households have been known for their poor targeting and high fiscal costs. However, the distributional benefits to the 160million households that use kerosene are not well understood. In this paper, the kerosene subsidy is formally assessed as an instrument of income redistribution. The subsidy incidence, progressivity and efficacy of the kerosene subsidy are calculated for the state of Maharashtra, under actual and ideal implementation conditions. The analysis shows that kerosene subsidies are regressive and of minimal financial value to poor rural households. This is in part because household quotas are based on cooking needs, but kerosene is used predominantly for lighting. In urban areas, subsidies are progressive, and provide benefits of up to 5 to 10\% of household expenditure among poorer households which lack affordable access to LPG and biomass. Overall, only 26\% of the total subsidy value directly reaches households. This analysis suggests that subsidies targeted only to kerosene-dependent urban areas would have a higher efficacy than broad-based subsidies.},

For example, when the data include some variables with non-trivial amounts of missing values, the mixture model may ﬁt the marginal distributions of the nearly and fully complete variables at the expense of the variables with high fractions of missing data. Motivated by this setting, we present a mixture model for mixed ordinal and nominal data that splits variables into two groups, focus variables and remainder variables. The model allows the analyst to specify a rich sub-model for the focus variables and a simpler sub-model for remainder variables, yet still capture associations among the variables. Using simulations, we illustrate advantages and limitations of focused clustering compared to mixture models that do not distinguish variables. We apply the model to handle missing values in an analysis of the 2012 American National Election Study, estimating relationships among voting behavior, ideology, and political party aﬃliation.},

In the wake of the creation of a Green Climate Fund in Cancun, this paper studies empirically the effect of the introduction of the Electricity Act 2003 and the Tariff Policy 2006, as well as the implementation of feed-in tariffs and minimum quotas on clean electricity sourcing, on the development of grid-connected renewable energy power in nine Indian States over the period 2001–2009. Results suggest that the passing of the Tariff Policy 2006, state-level policies, quantity-based instruments and a greater participation of the private sector have played a key role in promoting the development of installed capacity from renewable energy power in the nine States of the sample.},

The fuelwood consumption was estimated to be 1.79, 2.12 and 3.07 ton/capita/year, respectively, in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate climate. The fuelwood availability was observed to be 8.47 m tons against the projected requirement of 22.21 m tons during the year 2001, indicating a deficit by with of 61.0\% between demand and supply which is expected to increase to 77.0 and 83.0\%, respectively, by the year 2011 and 2021. The data revealed that labour energy expenditure on firewood collection was highest (86.78 MJ/capita/year) in tropical zone and lowest (36.90 MJ/capita/year) in temperate region. Fuelwood energy consumption was, however, recorded highest in temperate region (51.88 MJ × 103/capita/year) as against of 30.25 MJ × 103/capita/year in tropical zone. Among various activities, cooking required maximum energy, followed by space heating. The estimated growing stock was not able to sustain the rate of fuelwood consumption. Hence, restoration of degraded lands is need of the hour not only to meet the energy requirements of the tribal folk but also to maintain the ecological balance in fragile eco-system of the region, where slash and burn agriculture has already caused severe environmental degradation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one’s knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere.},

Big data offer the potential for cities to obtain valuable insights from a large amount of data collected through various sources, and the IoT allows the integration of sensors, radio-frequency identification, and Bluetooth in the real-world environment using highly networked services. The combination of the IoT and big data is an unexplored research area that has brought new and interesting challenges for achieving the goal of future smart cities. These new challenges focus primarily on problems related to business and technology that enable cities to actualize the vision, principles, and requirements of the applications of smart cities by realizing the main smart environment characteristics. In this paper, we describe the state-of-the-art communication technologies and smart-based applications used within the context of smart cities. The visions of big data analytics to support smart cities are discussed by focusing on how big data can fundamentally change urban populations at different levels. Moreover, a future business model of big data for smart cities is proposed, and the business and technological research challenges are identified. This study can serve as a benchmark for researchers and industries for the future progress and development of smart cities in the context of big data.},

We use a rural subsample of nationally representative data from the 2012 Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS) conducted in all twenty districts. We estimate a bivariate probit model to control for the potentially endogenous information variable. The results indicate that households that have access to information are approximately 39\% more likely to adopt clean cooking fuel. Similarly, households are 49\% less likely to adopt dirty fuel (firewood) when exposed to information. Other factors such as education, the electricity supply, access to liquidity and the distance to the market are important factors that contribute to adopting clean cooking fuel. The results also show that the effect of information varies depending on the level of education of the household heads, thus highlighting the importance of accounting for the level of education of information recipients when designing a similar information provision.},

	abstract = {In 2011, a government initiative provided Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) stoves and cylinders to almost 1000 rural families in Chiapas, Mexico. In 2017, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) conducted an evaluation of cooking practices among the beneficiaries of these stoves. Although almost 100\% of households continue to use firewood for cooking, they cook an average of 58\% of their food with LPG. Of the families that used to rely exclusively on firewood before 2011, 32\% have now started to use LPG. Primary cooks —almost entirely women— recognize the advantages of cooking with LPG and the health Problems associated with firewood use, with the primary barrier to using LPG being its high cost. Women spend 35–65 h a month preparing tortillas —the main food cooked with firewood. The alternative store-bought tortillas are up to three times costlier. When given the opportunity to cook with LPG, families recognize its advantages and are incentivized to continue using it, despite its cost. The higher the socioeconomic status, the higher LPG use is. The authors suggest that subsidizing tortilla production could facilitate the exclusive use of LPG, avoiding the negative health impacts of firewood use and saving more than 25\% of women's productive time.},

	abstract = {The adoption and sustained use of improved cookstoves are critical performance parameters of the cooking system that must be monitored just like the rest of the stove technical requirements to ensure the sustainability of their benefits. No stove program can achieve its goals unless people initially accept the stoves and continue using them on a long-term basis. When a new stove is brought into a household, commonly a stacking of stoves and fuels takes place with each device being used for the cooking practices where it fits best. Therefore, to better understand the adoption process and assess the impacts of introducing a new stove it is necessary to examine the relative advantages of each device in terms of each of the main cooking practices and available fuels. An emerging generation of sensor-based tools is making possible continuous and objective monitoring of the stove adoption process (from acceptance to sustained use or disadoption), and has enabled its scalability. Such monitoring is also needed for transparent verification in carbon projects and for improved dissemination by strategically targeting the users with the highest adoption potential and the substitution of cooking practices with the highest indoor air pollution or greenhouse gas contributions.},

A technological innovation—i.e., improved cookstoves—reduce fuel consumption and address the health effects of indoor air pollution. Implementation projects have been conducted worldwide, but have frequently faced very low success rates. Different demographic and socio-economic factors have been analysed to explain low rates but there are almost no studies that try to understand, from the users’ perspective, the factors involved when choosing among different cooking technologies. Through a qualitative methodological approach we documented the adoption of improved cookstoves through the implementation programme of a Mexican NGO. Results showed that although the programme raised public awareness, the improved cookstoves did not reach the poorest sector. The socioeconomic level was found positively correlated with the adoption of the improved cookstoves, but neither the age nor the educational levels were. Payment of the stove did not seem to be an adoption factor. Differences among individual users were more significant than differences between communities. Finally as men are the principal fuelwood harvesters, they should be considered as an important group in diffusion programs.},

The growing availability of empirical data and the capability of building modelling software has, more recently, allowed these differences to be reduced. This paper demonstrates, across two very different case-studies in UK and India, that techniques for community energy modelling can be used in a way that maintains detail in energy demand characteristics, thus helping to bridge the gap between detailed building assessment and higher-level energy system modelling. However, understanding the portability of such techniques requires an understanding of energy characteristics that can be specific to a geographic area. This study documents these important differences and proposes a more transferrable approach to detailed community energy modelling.},

In developing countries, factors determining fuel use are multi-faceted and complex. A survey was thus conducted to better understand the current household fuel usage profile in four regions of Kenya; namely Bomet, Voi, Mombasa and Narok. The fuel use parameters investigated covered bio-data and economic status, dwelling type, fuel choice and usage, combustion devices and ventilation in kitchens. The fuel type usage was distributed between firewood (25 \%), charcoal (24 \%), kerosene (24 \%) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (23 \%). Three-stone stoves were still predominant in rural communities, whilst cleaner devices burning kerosene and LPG were used more widely in urban Mombasa. With the exception of Voi, there were more chimneys in urban dwellings than in the rural homes, even though brick houses were the most popular dwelling type overall (52 \%). The results of this study will provide a useful basis for decision making regarding potential future clean energy intervention strategies in Kenya in order to promote sustainable development.},

This paper proposes a solution for sustainable residential heating in regions experiencing moderate Winters. The solution integrates the effects of intelligent design and operation. It encompasses minimization of thermal inadequacy, renewable energy incorporation, and optimal policy for the heating controls. Through a case study for an apartment in Jordan, the merits of the proposed solution are highlighted in terms of performance, feasibility, and environmental-friendliness using a detailed physical model. It was found out that thermal inadequacy could double both electricity consumption and generated CO2. Additionally, despite having global warming potential for their working fluids, utilization of heat pumps instead of electric heaters can reduce CO2 emissions by 75 \% with a payback period as short as 15 heating months. Finally, various heating schemes are examined. A proposed policy which represents a hybrid control technique merging threshold controller with demand-based zone heating was found to be capable of handling the trinary trade off resulting from thermal comfort, cost reduction, and minimum number of heating system starts. An optimal set of lower and upper bounds for active and inactive periods were found.},

This paper argues that retrofitting initiatives need to extend their current emphasis on technical-material changes to include an equally strong focus on researching and potentially changing the energy-related expectations, aspirations and actual activities of those who inhabit and use these buildings. The concept of energy cultures serves as a useful heuristic to structure the analysis of household energy demand and internal environment. Covering three key elements of energy culture – 1) material conditions that relate directly to domestic energy use, 2) householders’ attitudes, perceptions and norms concerning the use of energy and 3) observable everyday practices that use energy –, and their interactions, we examine data from 20 households in a social housing estate in Ireland collected before and after retrofitting. Overall, the results highlight the urgent need for an integrated approach to energy retrofitting that combines technology-aided changes in material conditions with a parallel re-shaping of householders’ views and practices to achieve real and lasting reductions in energy use. The latter seems particularly pressing given both the persistence of many energy-intensive domestic activities and the possible emergence of rebound effects that have the potential to cancel out at least some of the savings made through retrofitting.},

Particulate matter has emerged as a serious pollution threat in India, specifically to the capital—New Delhi.

The implemented methodology has a wide-scoped utility in the field of air pollution; especially in Low-Middle Income Countries where setting up new monitoring stations include financial/logistical/location problems. The generated maps can help in policy formulation and decision making by providing aid in PM2.5 visualisation of spatial and temporal variability. First phase of study involves prediction of concentrations at two sites (reinforcing the need for sustainable development of the city) using concentrations for 2015–2017. In the second phase, pollutant mixing ratios were obtained for four winter months between Nov-2017 to Feb-2018 at 17 monitoring stations. In this phase, predictions were made for 11 supersites (zones of important land-use). The average error of Kriging and IDW (taking both phases) was ∼22 \% and 24 \%, respectively. The magnitude of change in the daily concentration was relatively negligible and annual trend can be identified.},

We seek to conduct a society-wide analysis by providing a national-scale macro analysis and discuss the social quantile effects of building types and materials on household electricity consumption. With data obtained from two waves of nationally representative household surveys, the Blinder-Oaxaca (BD) and the Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (FFL) decomposition methods are used for the mean and quantile analyses, respectively. The mean analysis indicates that significant reductions in electricity consumption can be achieved by utilizing natural materials in both urban and rural regions. The FFL decomposition further affirms the use of natural materials in housing can mitigate the electricity consumption among urban occupants even at the 90th quantile. It is recommended that the merits of vernacular houses be emphasized in climate and energy policies, and further measures should be taken to promote vernacular architecture through design and planning guidelines.},

However, these data are produced with a relatively long cycle, and they hardly reflect the built environment characteristics that affect the livelihoods of the inhabitants. Open-access social media data can be used as an alternative data source for the study of poverty. They typically provide fine-grained information with a short updating cycle. Therefore, in this study, we developed a new approach to measure urban poverty using multi-source big data. We used social media data and remote sensing images to represent the social conditions and the characteristics of built environments, respectively. These data were used to produce the indicators of material, economic, and living conditions, which are closely related to poverty. They were integrated into a composite index, namely the Multi-source Data Poverty Index (MDPI), based on the random forest (RF) algorithm. A dataset of the General Deprivation Index (GDI) derived from the census data was used as a reference to facilitate the training of RF. A case study was carried out in Guangzhou, China, to evaluate the performance of the proposed MDPI for measuring the community-level urban poverty. The results showed a high consistency between the MDPI and GDI. By analyzing the MDPI results, we found a significantly positive spatial autocorrelation in the community-level poverty condition in Guangzhou. Compared with the GDI approach, the proposed MDPI could be updated more conveniently using big data to provide more timely information of urban poverty.},

In this paper we present the experience of a Swiss city, where, against a past background of resistance to participatory processes, a “living” lab experiment was set for the co-creation of a behavior change app targeting a reduction in car-based traffic. Motivated by the opportunity to overcome limitations of such apps, the lab turned out to deliver wider benefits than initially expected. In fact, the concrete experience of new mobility behaviors stimulated by the app activated a collective learning process among lab participants. Discussions in the lab thus spontaneously scaled-up to far-reaching and potentially conflicting topics about future mobility scenarios. Furthermore, the protected space of the lab favored strengthening of reciprocal trust between citizens and policy-makers, opening-up possibilities for adoption of participatory practices also in future decision-making.},

American Thoracic Society questionnaire was adopted as a study tool having additional questions on fuel subsidy and options, barriers for cleaner fuels choice, including the willingness to pay. Type of cooking fuel choice varies significantly with the monthly income of the family and 67\% household uses solid biomass fuel (SBF) as a primary fuel, whereas 21\% liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Distance for the collection of clean fuel, the taste of meal and season were identified as important determinants for the choice of household cooking fuel. Weekly cooking fuel cost was found to be highest (\$3.1) in SBF users followed by mixed (\$2.6) and LPG (\$1.3) fuel users. Against the market price of \$9.9 per cylinder of LPG, the average willingness to pay was \$4.1. The decision for cooking fuel is mostly taken by women (48\%), although they prefer SBF for cooking and collect it (75\%). As the SBF users were found ignorant about the associated non-communicable diseases, study urges to create awareness about the adverse health effects of household air pollution to increase the energy transition towards cleaner fuels.},

	abstract = {Climate change and other sustainability challenges represent a foundational contest to traditional urban development concepts and practices. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from urban infrastructure and leading cities towards climate resilience requires a transformation of city structures, its organisation and its resident’s lifestyles. To anchor such a transformative course of action, a wider societal consensus building with an active and earnest engagement with all relevant actors and interest groups in the city is required. With stakeholder dialogues being a suitable and proven instrument for stimulating engagement, this paper explores dynamics of stakeholder dialogues and how they can advance a city’s work on climate change. For this purpose, a number of stakeholder dialogues with key actors in the field of climate change were organised in four cities across India, Indonesia and the Philippines. Studying them, the authors identified four dimensions that seem to shape the effectiveness and success of such dialogues: the level of interaction between the participants during the events, the diversity of perspectives represented by the stakeholders, their level of capacities in dealing with urban climate issues and, ultimately their political competence that allows them to take decisions based on workshop outcomes.},

	abstract = {Solid biomass fuel use is closely intertwined with the life of rural households in Asia. However, its consumption and demand vary significantly across different countries, states and in various agro-climatic zones. Uses of solid biomass fuel in the kitchen not only leads to household air pollution but also influences the air quality in the regions of Indo- Gangetic plains. Considering this, current study assesses the household fuel use pattern and trend in India. Further, the socio-cultural, economical and behavioral factors which can influence the household fuel choice were evaluated through a case study from Punjab, India using a standard questionnaire. The decadal trend in household energy consumption pattern shows that 77.5\% of rural households in India rely on solid biomass fuel for cooking. Further, during the last 30 years (upto 2011), only 2\% of rural households shifted from solid biomass fuel to cleaner fuels. However, after 2011 data shows significant uptake of the cleaner fuels for the household cooking purposes. Results of the case study show that rural households depend on numerous approaches rather than relying on a particular source of household energy. This contradicts the energy ladder hypothesis of improvement in energy source with an increase in income. Cooking fuel preferences were found to be significantly determined by socio-economic and cultural factors. Thus, providing improved cookstoves or cleaner fuels are not sufficient to attain their sustained use. Hence, the current study highlights the need for effective user-behavior focused interventions to enhance the transition towards cleaner fuel for household energy.},

In contrast to worst-case error, this criterion relies on the construction of a probability measure over candidate numerical tasks, and numerical methods are assessed based on their average performance over those tasks with respect to the measure. This paper goes further and establishes Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods as solutions to certain inverse problems based upon the numerical task within the Bayesian framework. This allows us to establish general conditions under which Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are well defined, encompassing both the nonlinear and non-Gaussian contexts. For general computation, a numerical approximation scheme is proposed and its asymptotic convergence established. The theoretical development is extended to pipelines of computation, wherein probabilistic numerical methods are composed to solve more challenging numerical tasks. The contribution highlights an important research frontier at the interface of numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification, and a challenging industrial application is presented.},

Realization of these benefits has proven elusive because even when the promoted fuels-stoves are used in the long term they are often combined (i.e., “stacked”) with the traditional ones to fulfill all household needs originally met with open fires. This paper reviews the rationale for stacking in terms of the roles of end uses, cooking tasks, livelihood strategies, and the main patterns of use resulting from them. It uses evidence from case studies in different countries and from a 1-year-long field study conducted in 100 homes in three villages of Central Mexico; outlining key implications for household fuel savings, energy use, and health. We argue for the implementation of portfolios of clean fuels, devices and improved practices tailored to local needs to broaden the use niches that stove programs can cover and to reduce residual open fire use. This allows to integrate stacking into diagnosis tools, program monitoring, evaluation schemes, and implementation strategies and establish critical actions that researchers and project planners can consider when faced with actual or potential fuel-device stacking.},

	abstract = {Growing household energy demand, particularly in developing countries starting from a low base of consumption, is an important driver of current and future greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, our understanding of transitioning residential energy demand in developing country contexts is limited. This paper discusses changing energy service demands in urban low-income households in India, an emerging economy where the largest future growth in energy demand globally is projected to occur, and where 12 million new low-income homes for the urban poor are to be built by the government between 2015 and 2022. Based on mixed quantitative and qualitative methods comprising of surveys, interviews and focus group discussions, we analyze two inter-related questions: how does the demand for energy services change as the ability of low-income households to consume increases; and how do energy related behaviors influence household electricity consumption? We analyze the data collected to rank households according to their ability to consume and to identify the types of, and progression in, energy services acquired. The appliances and associated services pursued are lights, fans, televisions, and refrigerators, with varied energy efficiencies. Analogously, we quantify the influence of behavior in determining electricity consumption, and show that the inclusion of socio-demographic and behavioral factors explain a significant proportion (51\%) of the variance in household electricity consumption, along with the role of material factors such as building physical characteristics and appliance stocks. We complement the statistical analysis with qualitative fieldwork and discuss changing energy related behaviors as the ability of households to consume increases. We conclude with recommendations for climate actions that are compatible with development in the growing low-income housing stock.},

	abstract = {The interaction of all mobile species with their environment hinges on their movement patterns: the places they visit and how frequently they go there. In human society, where the prevalent form of cohabitation is in cities, the highly dynamic and diverse movement of people is fundamental to almost every aspect of socio-economic life, including social interactions or disease spreading, and ultimately is key to the evolution of urban infrastructure, productivity, innovation and technology. However, despite the crucial role of the spatio-temporal structure of movement in cities, the laws that govern the variation of population flows to specific locations have remained elusive. Here we show that behind the apparent complexity of movement a surprisingly simple universal scaling relation drives the flow of individuals to any specific location based on both frequency of visitation and distance travelled. We derive a first principles argument stating that the number of visiting individuals should decrease as an inverse square of the product of visitation frequency and travel distance; or, equivalently, as a power law with exponent \${\textbackslash}approx {\textbackslash}! -\$2. Using large-scale data analyses, we demonstrate that population flows obey this theoretical prediction in virtually all tested areas across the globe, ranging from Europe and America to Asia and Africa, regardless of the detailed geographies, cultures or levels of development. The revealed regularity offers unprecedented possibilities for the modelling of mobility fluxes at high spatial and temporal resolution, and it places an important constraint on any theory of movement, spatial organisation and social interaction in cities.},

In the energy poverty scholarship, it is a well-argued concept that social systems influence people’s energy choices. Influenced by theories of Practice, this study explores the role that social structure plays in the perpetuation of the use of solid cooking fuels, with a particular focus on rural India. We employ a qualitative approach of inquiry for data collection in three villages in Chittoor district in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The results presented in this paper are based on in-depth household interviews and focus group discussions. The findings suggest that cooking with solid fuels is intertwined with structural elements, such as established traditions, traditional income generating practices, gender norms, and a sense of belonging. These factors profoundly dominate households’ decisions to continue using solid fuels despite the availability and the adoption of modern alternatives. The paper argues that interventions targeted at reducing the use of solid fuels may fail if they: 1) focus only on supplying modern fuels; 2) do not consider contextual social barriers; and 3) are implemented as standalone projects.},

	abstract = {This article makes the case for a new and ambitious research and governance agenda for energy demand reduction. It argues that existing ‘demand-side’ approaches focused on promoting technological efficiency and informed individual consumption are unlikely to be adequate to achieving future carbon emissions reduction goals; it points out that very little attention has so far been paid to the impacts of non-energy policies on energy demand; and it submits that a much fuller integration of energy demand questions into policy is required. It advances a general framework, supported by illustrative examples, for understanding the impacts of ‘non-energy’ policies on energy demand. It reflects on why these connections have been so little explored and addressed within energy research and policy. And it argues that, for all their current ‘invisibility’, there is nonetheless scope for increasing the visibility of, and in effect ‘mainstreaming’, energy demand reduction objectives within other policy areas. Researchers and policymakers, we contend, need to develop better understandings of how energy demand might be made governable, and how non-energy policies might be revised, alone and in combination, to help steer long-term changes in energy demand.},

This carrier substitution process can be modeled as an income-dependent competition between two technologies for adoption by the households. The carrier shifts for cooking have provided an empirical basis for the energy ladder concept, in which each step of the ladder corresponds to a different energy carrier and its associated appliance and the step up to which a household climbs the ladder depends upon its income. As society becomes more egalitarian, an energy ladder based on incomes should disappear. Thus, the real merit of the empirical and theoretical analysis of energy ladders presented here is that it serves as an excellent guide to policy formulation and intervention.},

	abstract = {From Victorian England and its colonies, to cities in South Asia today, “improvement” has long infused the language of urban planning. Through the case of Bangalore, India, this article argues that urban improvement should be understood as a project of liberal government forged in the crucible of empire and harnessed in the service of the state’s capital and spatial accumulation strategies. Once practiced by colonial planners, urban improvement fundamentally entails enhancing the value of urban space and its circulatory infrastructures through the mobilization of corrective behaviors related to property and propriety. In the process, improvement grafts race, class, caste, and other forms of social difference onto urban space, which in turn provides the justification for further improvement. Ultimately, improvement begets cycles of inequality and exclusion, even while it promises betterment and inclusion. Three improvement regimes are identified here: racialized improvement in the colonial city (1890s–1920s), classed improvement in the industrial city (1930s–1970s), and marketized improvement in the world-class city (1980s–2010s). The article further shows that with each wave of urban improvement came vernacular and nationalist responses that sought to extend housing and services to unserved constituents. These indigenous calibrations are as important to the genealogy of improvement as its original European form.},

Given the scarcity of existing information on this subject, this study uses a semi-structured interview format to explore the key behavioral tendencies, energy knowledge gaps, and attitudes among low-income public housing residents, with the goal of demonstrating a process for developing, scoring, and analyzing the interviews that will be useful to other researchers when first engaging complex subjects like behavior in contexts that are not well covered by existing literature. Methods for sampling subjects and iteratively developing an interview guide and response-scoring framework are described, and the usefulness of this approach in allowing both quantitative and qualitative analysis of behavior response data is demonstrated. The paper concludes by illustrating how themes that emerge from the response analysis can be used to inform future surveying and intervention efforts. Key themes include the varying definitions for “comfort” amongst residents; the lack of resident control over the household environment; the tendency for residents to evaluate energy conservation measures (ECMs) in terms of costs, savings, and comfort; the muted differences in behavior between those who do and do not pay energy bills; and the importance of building maintenance and resident energy education to ongoing efficiency efforts.},

We report three main results. First, education is a strong predictor of LPG adoption. Second, perceptions that LPG is good and affordable and progressive health-related perceptions are associated with LPG ownership. Third, and surprisingly, education does not predict positive attitudes toward clean cooking fuels. These results suggest that education leads to LPG adoption, but not through attitudinal changes. Further research should examine the mediators of the robust observed education-adoption association.},

Girls below 5 and females in 30–60 age-groups have higher proportion of respiratory symptoms than males of similar age-groups. While many studies are done on the health impact of cooking fuels, very little quantitative work is done on the other aspects of the fuel chain viz. collection, transportation and processing of fuels.

This paper investigates the demand for domestic fuels when households face four choices: Fuelwood, Coal, Kerosene and LPG. The study is based on a survey of 500 households in Kolkata, India. The demand estimates are conducted using a two-stage process where the first stage investigates choice and the second the quantity used. Determinants of fuel demand are identified and their relative importance shown. Extending the study, the paper also analyses the choice of the main cooking fuel in terms of the households' stated rankings of six fuels for five attributes. The policy discussion indicates that subsidies have less potential to reduce polluting fuels such as coal and fuelwood due to weak cross-price elasticities, while increased availability of LPG and potentially also increased awareness of indoor air pollution have greater prospect.},

	abstract = {Solid biomass fuel use is closely intertwined with the life of rural households in Asia. However, its consumption and demand vary significantly across different countries, states and in various agro-climatic zones. Uses of solid biomass fuel in the kitchen not only leads to household air pollution but also influences the air quality in the regions of Indo- Gangetic plains. Considering this, current study assesses the household fuel use pattern and trend in India. Further, the socio-cultural, economical and behavioral factors which can influence the household fuel choice were evaluated through a case study from Punjab, India using a standard questionnaire. The decadal trend in household energy consumption pattern shows that 77.5\% of rural households in India rely on solid biomass fuel for cooking. Further, during the last 30 years (upto 2011), only 2\% of rural households shifted from solid biomass fuel to cleaner fuels. However, after 2011 data shows significant uptake of the cleaner fuels for the household cooking purposes. Results of the case study show that rural households depend on numerous approaches rather than relying on a particular source of household energy. This contradicts the energy ladder hypothesis of improvement in energy source with an increase in income. Cooking fuel preferences were found to be significantly determined by socio-economic and cultural factors. Thus, providing improved cookstoves or cleaner fuels are not sufficient to attain their sustained use. Hence, the current study highlights the need for effective user-behavior focused interventions to enhance the transition towards cleaner fuel for household energy.},

Findings summarise that accessibility and overall WASH performance during 2011-12 were better than 2004–05. The change was not significant across cities in terms of WASH availability during the survey years. The availability of WASH was poor, but accessibility was better in Mumbai. Chennai reported a reverse trend, where availability was better, but accessibility was poor. The overall level of WASH became significantly better in Mumbai during 2011-12 compared to 2004-05, but changes were minor in other cities. The cities with poor WASH performance (Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chennai) exhibited more inequality compared to better performing cities (Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi). The intra-city inequality is attributable to housing conditions, economic status, educational level, socio-religious affiliation, and occupational status. The efficiency with equity in WASH performance – both between and within cities should be the prioritised issue for urban policies to make cities more socially inclusive and sustainable.},

In this work, various key enablers influencing SSC development are extracted through literature. The BWM technique is utilised to identify their intensity of influence and ISM is used to develop a structural framework for successfully executing the SSC development projects. Several major categories of enablers, such as energy and environmental, infrastructural, strategy and policy oriented, informational and technological, social and personal, and mobility possess strong influence on SSC development agenda. The results reveals that sustainable resources management, development of smart buildings, advanced research and development system, and intelligent transportation are the key enablers of the developed framework. The fuzzy MICMAC analysis further assists in computing the driving power and dependence of the enablers. This research work will be beneficial for policy makers and practitioners in understanding of smart city development and would certainly help to grow nations’ economy by generating higher employment, foreign investments, and developing superior technological advancements.},

In this study, the sources and characteristics of 16 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with the emission of particulate matter (PM) from semi-urban, urban, and rural sections of Jamshedpur City, India was investigated using advanced gas chromatography. The results of sampling conducted during winter and summer seasons suggest that the total PAHs average concentration level were higher in the winter season than the concentration level in the summer season. During the winter season, the average concentration of total PAHs from semi-urban, urban, and rural sites were found to be 47.73 ± 10.65, 37 ± 9.56, and 109.06 ± 18.21 ng/m3 respectively while in summer season, the concentration was observed to be 39.61 ± 6.87, 81.14 ± 13.30 and 36.33 ± 9.97 ng/m3 over semi-urban, urban and rural site respectively. Of all the PAHs, Phenanthrene (Phe) was among the most abundant PAH in both winter and summer seasons over the entire study site. Diagnostic Ratio Analysis (DRA) \& Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that major emission sources of PAHs were; the vehicles, petrogenic, and biomass and coal combustion sources over semi-urban, urban, and rural site. BaP \& DBahA were used as the surrogate compounds in assessing PAHs health risk. The Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (ELCR) value over the semi-urban, urban, and rural site was calculated as 10.25 × 10−6, 23.09 × 10−6 and 18.86 × 10−6 respectively.},

Still, having a connection is not enough to eliminate household air pollution. Studying panel data from rural households in six major states from 2014–2015 and 2018, we assess the determinants of cooking energy transition from solid fuels to LPG. We find that PMUY beneficiaries have much lower odds of using LPG as the primary or exclusive fuel compared with general customers, irrespective of their economic status. Village-level penetration of LPG as a primary fuel and the years of LPG use positively influence its sustained use, while ease of access to freely available biomass and reliance on uncertain and irregular income sources hinder LPG use. The findings highlight the need to interlace cooking fuel policies with rural development, to enable a complete transition towards cleaner cooking fuels.},

Kinetic models for starch gelatinization and browning development were coupled to the transport model. Input variables to the model were oven temperature, heat transfer coefficient, and bread radius. A total of 105 operating conditions were simulated using the finite element method, and the end point of baking was established for three values of surface lightness. It is shown that an intense heating strategy can produce a browned but unbaked product, besides nutritional quality is negatively affected. Furthermore, minimization of baking time is restricted by internal resistance to heat transfer.},

	abstract = {Energy consumption and product quality changes are often observed as the ratio of the convection to the conduction modes of heat transfer varies in industrial baking ovens. Air and oven-wall temperature profiles as well as air velocity can affect the convection/radiation heat transfer and hence the quality of the baked products. A programmable pilot-plant oven was used to establish five baking profiles by measuring the total heat flux and the convective component using a special heat flux meter called an h-monitor. The purpose was to keep the total heat flux delivered to the h-monitor constant while varying the convective component from 27\% (for the standard profile) to 11\%, 22\%, 33\% and 37\% by modifying air characteristics and wall temperatures. Industrial cupcakes were baked using the five established baking profiles and then evaluated in terms of quality parameters. Compared to the standard profile, a 10\% reduction in volume expansion and a 30\% increase in texture properties were observed for extreme oven conditions; top colour was always darker but more uniform for the conditions with less convection. The moisture content of the middle part of the cake was always higher than that of the top, bottom and sides. Baking industries are interested in using the pilot-scale oven to modify baking profiles for the purposes of quality improvement, product development and energy savings, rather than having to engage in high-cost trial and error practices on the production site.},

Bread dough samples were instantaneously heated at different temperatures (60–90 °C) for varying times and then subjected to differential scanning calorimetry to evaluate the extent of starch gelatinization. Calorimetric traces, after smoothing and standardization, were deconvoluted into one or two Gaussian curves, depending on the treatment temperature and time. This suggests that the system is a mixture of two components, the second of which was found to have lower gelatinization rate. The kinetic parameterization was only applied to the second Gaussian curve. It was shown that the trend of the second peak fits well with firstorder kinetics, where the rate constant varies with temperature according to the Arrhenius equation (K0 = 2.8 × 1018/s; Ea = 139 kJmol).},

Additional experiments were performed with steam baking and falling temperature baking. Immediately after baking, the crust was divided into the outer and inner crust fractions, and the water content and acrylamide concentration of each fraction was measured. The outer crust had a significantly lower water content and higher acrylamide concentration than the inner crust did. Crust temperature in combination with water content had a significant effect on acrylamide formation, higher temperatures resulting in higher acrylamide concentrations. However, at very high temperatures and lower water contents, acrylamide concentration was observed to decrease, though the bread colour was then unacceptable for consumption. Steam and falling temperature baking, on the other hand, decreased the acrylamide content while producing bread crust with an acceptable colour. The lowest acrylamide values and an acceptable crust colour were produced by steam baking.},

The model is based on a moving boundary problem formulation with equivalent thermophysical properties. The transport problem is solved by using the finite element method and the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method is used to describe the motion of the boundary. The formulation is assessed by simulating the bread baking process and comparing numerical results with experimental data. Simulated temperature and water content profiles are in good agreement with experimental data obtained from bread baking tests. The model well describes the stated general problem and it is expected to be useful for other food processes involving similar phenomena.},

	abstract = {The relationship between bread-crumb cellular structure and many aspects of quality in a loaf of white bread justifies investigations of how the structure arises during processing of the dough. Following a brief overview of the development of bread cellular structure in the dough, three parts of the literature pertaining to crumb appearance (visual texture) and bread quality are reviewed, with emphasis on the mechanical properties (physical texture) of the crumb. The importance of an objective segmentation of the two macroscopic phases (crumb cells and cell walls solids) is emphasised in digital image analysis studies of bread-crumb structure. A review of studies where mechanical properties have been measured in fundamental units has sections on the mechanical properties of the composite structure and on recent analyses of the mechanical properties of the solid phase. Finally, models which have been used to relate structure to mechanical properties will be reviewed with emphasis on the work of Gibson and Ashby [Gibson, L.J., \& Ashby, M.F., 1988. Cellular solids: structure \& properties. Oxford: Pergamon Press; Gibson, L.J., \& Ashby, M.F., 1997. Cellular solids: structure and properties (2nd ed.). Cambridge: University Press]. It is shown that experimental values of Young's modulus of bread crumb reside within the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. Compared with the rule of mixtures, these bounds represent a good (52\%) improvement in the ability to predict values for bread crumb moduli (crumb firmness). Using information provided by digital image analysis, Gibson and Ashby's relationships between structure (relative density) and mechanical properties can be modified to incorporate dough processing effects such as dough strain hardening and the effect of gas cell coalescence.},

This research aims to establish an optimal temperature profile for white-sandwich bread to achieve the best product quality. Experiments were conducted by a multi-level partial factorial design, where dough was baked in a process with 4 equally divided zones. Mathematical models were established to describe the effects of tin temperature and baking time on bread quality attributes. Based on the models, by solving a constrained minimisation problem, the optimal tin temperature profile for the lowest weight loss was determined to be \{115 °C, 130 °C, 156 °C, 176 °C\} in the four zones with a baking time of 27.4 min. The crumb temperature was predicted to reach 99 °C, while the top crust colour, side crust colour and averaged crust colour were all within an acceptable range.},

This chapter begins with a brief description of the bread-making process. Bread-making stages include mixing the ingredients, dough resting, dividing and shaping, proofing, and baking, with great variation in the intermediate stage depending on the type of product. Bread dough is a versatile matrix that, after proofing and baking, yields a variety of bread products. Bread making is a dynamic process with continuous physicochemical, microbiological, and biochemical changes. In bread making, mixing is one of the key steps that determine the mechanical properties of the dough, which have a direct consequence on the quality of the end product.},

The results showed an increase in water content in the bread core at the very beginning of baking. However the core water content was the same as in raw dough after 7min of baking. These results were compared to previously published results, and the mechanisms of evaporation–condensation which are responsible for such local increases are defined.},

Experimental data (temperature, water content, weight loss, crust thickness) obtained during baking is used to well understand the simultaneous heat and mass transfer occurring during the process. The evaporation–condensation mechanism is responsible for the rapid heating of the porous matrix and takes place either in a closed (dough) or open (crumb) structure. The existence of a moving evaporation front inside bread, which is a determining step of baking, is incorporated in a model applying a moving boundary formulation with equivalent thermophysical properties. The approach proposed here can be extended to other similar processes such as baking of other products (e.g. biscuit, cake), high-temperature drying, cooking and roasting.},

	abstract = {Bread is one of the most widely consumed foods in the world and has been an integral part of the human diet for thousands of years. Although yeasts are considered the major leavening agent in bread production, the use of sourdough as a natural starter in bread-making is one of the oldest food biotechnologies. Sourdough has been recently rediscovered and extensively studied as a cell factory able to modify cereals and other dough ingredients to functional and nutritional bread. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview about the sourdough microbiota, as this has been described so far by both conventional and omics approaches, as well as its functionality with regard to the technological properties of bread, such as texture, flavor, shelf-life, and nutritional value. Moreover, the emerging use of alternative raw materials for sourdough and bread production, the application of nonconventional starters, along with the adaptation of existing and the development of novel technologies in tailor-made bread types, as for example in the case of gluten-free bread, are also considered. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Sourdough is a type of dough fermented by yeast and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used as sponge dough in bread making. Sourdough may have four classifications according to the fermentation type and the technological process used. On sourdough type I, the fermentation of yeasts and LAB present in the flour occurs spontaneously whereas in type II, fermentation occurs after the inoculation of a starter culture. Type III is simply type II sourdough dehydrated and type IV is a mixture of type I and type II sourdough, produced on laboratory scale. With LAB’s growth during fermentation, pH decreases with subsequent hydrolysis of starch and protein, favoring the growth of yeasts. The yeast in turn, releases amino acids during autolysis, contributing to the growth of LAB. Due to this synergistic growth of LAB and yeasts, the products obtained from sourdough show more concentration of flavor, more elastic dough, and a longer shelf life than bread fermented only by yeast. Although, the benefits of this technology, using sourdough, is present just in a few countries, where it is also possible to obtain the dehydrated sourdough starters, for domestic use, in local supermarkets. Due to its fermentative process complexity, this paper presents updated information about the fabrication process of sourdough, main factors affecting this process, benefits of sourdough use for bakery products, and the varieties of dehydrated sourdough commercially available throughout the world.},

This review focuses on the microstructure of wheat-flour dough from a mechanical and visual point of view. It provides an overview of the dependencies between the visibly detectable microstructural elements achieved by CLSM and the physical determined rheological properties.

In this paper, we propose a link between exergy analysis and nutrition to account for the exergy efficiency (exergy of output per exergy of input) in the metabolism of nutrients from foods in the human body. For this, we analyzed the exergy efficiency of four different chains of carbohydrate-rich products based on semi-industrial preparation processes and we included nutrient bioavailability through the use of several bioavailability indicators, including the glycemic index and protein digestibility. The least exergy efficient chain changed when not only looking at the exergy losses of the food processing chains, but also including the bioavailability and conversion of nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main molecule for energy storage in the body. When including only the processing chain, white bread presented the highest exergy loss, whereas the lowest values pointed to the spaghetti chain when also including metabolism both because of its preprocessing chain and its low bioavailability. In contrast, cooked potatoes were found to be an efficient source of ATP due to both a high metabolic efficiency and low process exergy losses. The carbohydrate bioavailability had a strong influence on the overall exergy efficiency of the studied cases, which shows the importance of including bioavailability aspects in the sustainability assessment of industrial food processing chains.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to assess the relationship between wheat flour analytical values and baked good properties based on equipment and processes near to those of mid-size bakery companies, including fermentation interruption. Thirty-four physical properties of rolls and breads were measured, and their correlation with 90 analytical properties of flour was investigated. In rolls, fermentation interruption led to a coarser crumb structure and a lower height/width ratio as compared to direct fermentation. This can be seen as a quality loss, which extent varied considerably depending on the flour. Our results suggest that using flours with a strong gluten network and high water absorption properties are most appropriate for fermentation interruption. Using a PLS regression, we identified three flour properties that had the highest overall influence on the final baked goods properties: flour hydration, dough stability, and elasticity/plasticity ratio.},

	abstract = {Oral processing has become an important area of research in sensory and nutrition studies. Mastication process not only determines the dynamics of flavour release and texture perception but also affects the bioavailability of nutrients. Oral processing of bread is of particular interest because of the need to reduce its glycaemic potential while keeping its desired soft and aerated texture. Bread structure determines its mechanical strength and deformation behaviour which in turn decides people's texture perception and swallowing thresholds. The strong interconnection between food structure and its resistance to breakdown is the rationale behind designing bread to control bread digestion, starting from the oral phase. The present review summarises the characterisation and formation of bread structure, its interlink with bread mechanical behaviour and destruction during human oral processing. Future research should further elucidate the structure–mechanics–digestion interlink by implementing relevant mechanical analyses and micromechanical modelling.},

	abstract = {Water is an integral part of wheat flour dough—the amount, physical state, and location of water are crucial to the formation of a dough that will hold gas and produce an open, aerated crumb structure in the final product. This has been understood for centuries by craft bakers, who were highly attuned to the “feel” of dough in their hands. In the 20th century, empirical instruments were invented that simulated part of the breadmaking process, and their limited predictive capacity made them valuable quality control tools. During the latter decades of the 20th century the cost and availability of advanced instrumental methods for characterizing foods improved dramatically, and facilitated a “fundamental science” approach to food research. The physicochemical mechanisms by which water exerts such a strong influence on the character of dough are now better understood. This review contrasts the empirical and fundamental view points, and summarizes recent knowledge about the roles of water in the manufacture of fresh and frozen yeasted dough.},

Farinograph responses revealed the significant role of DC (α {\textless} 0.001) and mixing temperature (MT) (α {\textless} 0.001) on wheat bread dough elasticity. Fermentation responses obtained from the rheofermentometer showed that the DC induces a significant positive linear effect on dough development, whereas gas development was mainly governed by the fermentation temperature. The wheat bread dough behaviour subjected to a dual mechanical shear stress and temperature constraint showed that DC had a significant linear and positive effect on the starch gelatinisation and gelling process. Therefore, breadmaking is highly governed for DC, namely dough hydration, which has a direct consequence on the mixing, fermenting, cooking and cooling performance of the wheat bread dough.},

	abstract = {Wheat roasting is generally performed to enhance organoleptic properties of the end product, however, often with an inevitable effect on quality. This study investigated the physicochemical, structural and functional properties of the flour and whole wheat kernels after being roasted at 180 °C for 140 s using a conventional oven and a homogeneous and energy-efficient forced convection continuous tumble (FCCT) roaster. Wheat kernels tend to puff upon roasting, resulting in a significant (p ≤ 0.05) decrease in weight, bulk density, moisture content, flour yield, protein content and hardness for both roasting methods. FCCT roasting uses superheated steam instead of dry heat, which explains the lower weight loss with this roasting method compared to oven roasting. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated the minor influence of FCCT roasting on kernel structure. The structural changes, although not significantly different (p {\textgreater} 0.05), impacted on the degree of gelatinisation (FCCT = 10.14\%; oven = 17.16\%). Rheological characteristics, measured with an alveograph, were not affected (p {\textgreater} 0.05) by either roasting methods, whereas the peak time, measured with a mixograph, increased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) for both. The roasting conditions used did not result in a detrimental effect on the potential bread baking quality and may, in addition, delay staling with subsequent extension of shelf life. Further work is required to evaluate the quality and shelf life of baked products made with flour milled from roasted wheat kernels.},

In general, milling influenced the quality of these products more than the type of wheat selected. Among the various mill streams, the last break and reduction streams produced lower quality bread and must be eliminated in milling. These streams had a higher protein and ash content, showing the presence of components of the outer layers of the grain. The flour was able to absorb more water, but had less extensibility in kneading and the dough generated was weaker due the poorer quality of its proteins and the influence of elements from the outer layers. Thus, bread made from these streams had smaller volume, had a firmer texture and had both darker crumb and crust. These differences, along with the effect of the kind of flour on the flavor and aroma of the bread, made it less acceptable than flour from the rest of the streams studied.},

	abstract = {This work studied rheological and thermal properties of dough and textural and microstructural features of bread with pulque, a white sap made from the juice of certain species of agave in Mexico, as leavening agent. To this end, a basic dough recipe (wheat flour-33.7\%, sugar-2.5\%, salt-0.5\%, and water-63.3\% w/w) was used as control. Dough variations were produced by substituting water (25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\% v/v) by pulque. The leavening volume of all the dough variations exhibited an increase of about 50\% relative to the control dough, where only commercial yeast was used. Increasing pulque concentrations decreased dough apparent viscosity. The addition of pulque also decreased dough crystallinity (approx. 40\%), indicating that the fermentation process disrupted the internal organization of starch granules. Furthermore, the incorporation of pulque induced an important decrease (approx. 55\%) of the moisture diffusivity in the bread, suggesting that bacteria consortiums in pulque improved water binding by altering the protein structure. In turn, reduced moisture mobility led to reduced weight loss during bread baking. The results showed that pulque is a suitable source of leavening for the fabrication of bread specialties with improved textural and microstructural features.},

However, epidemiologists are still largely unfamiliar with MCMC. They may lack familiarity either with he implementation of MCMC or with interpretation of the resultant output. As with tutorials outlining the calculus behind maximum likelihood in previous decades, a simple description of the machinery of MCMC is needed. We provide an introduction to conducting analyses with MCMC, and show that, given the same data and under certain model specifications, the results of an MCMC simulation match those of methods based on standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). In addition, we highlight examples of instances in which MCMC approaches to data analysis provide a clear advantage over MLE. We hope that this brief tutorial will encourage epidemiologists to consider MCMC approaches as part of their analytic tool-kit.},

The paper presents a methodology to estimate the energy performance of all residential properties and combined with census data identifies what distinguishes the most energy inefficient properties, whether it is location, ownership, age or other characteristic. Data from the Irish EPC database suggests that 25\% of the Irish residential housing stock is in the most energy inefficient categories, whereas the methodology developed suggests that it is substantially higher at 35\%. The results also find that there is a substantially greater likelihood that the elderly, or families living in rental properties live in the most energy inefficient properties.},

Bottom-up engineering-based housing stock models can help to serve such a function. These models require calibrating, using micro-level energy measurements at the building level, to improve model accuracy; however, the only publicly available data for the UK housing stock is at the macro-level, at the district, urban, or national scale. This paper outlines a method for using macro-level data to calibrate micro-level models. A hierarchical framework is proposed, utilizing a combination of regression analysis and Bayesian inference. The result is a Bayesian regression method that generates estimates of the average energy use for different dwelling types whilst quantifying uncertainty in both the empirical data and the generated energy estimates. Finally, the Bayesian regression method is validated and the use of the hierarchical Bayesian calibration framework is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the evaluation and quantification of energy poverty in Madrid, at the city and district level. The incidence of energy poverty is assessed by means of the High Share of Energy Expenditure in Income indicator combined with the monetary poverty perspective, enabling to identify different energy-poor household profiles. The study links the city and district statistical levels. The analysis of the different household groups at the city level allows identifying several determining factors linked to energy poverty in Madrid. Based on these determining factors, this research explores district statistics by following an area-based approach and assesses its energy poverty distribution. The High Energy Requirements index is then built on these determining factors to help to pinpoint the urban areas where energy-poor households are more prone to be located. The results show that 22.7\% of households are at risk of energy poverty and suggest a need for effectively incorporating households’ income levels and a monetary approach into energy poverty assessments. Finally, based on the two-scale (city and district) analysis conducted, this paper concludes with energy retrofitting policy guidelines, distinguishing between the different levels of funding, and the efficiency measures to be implemented according to each particular energy poverty condition.},

Whilst improvements in data sources and methods in recent years provide an opportunity to better understand the spatial distribution of fuel poverty, these analyses suggest that our understanding of the incidence and spatial distribution of fuel poverty is highly sensitive to the way in which household incomes are measured.},

	abstract = {Fuel poverty has generally been calculated by quantifying the number of households spending in excess of 10\% of income on home heating. This definition has a number of significant practical and scientific limitations. This paper employs self-reported data to calculate the severity of fuel poverty in Ireland to identify chronic fuel-poor households from occasional sufferers. It also assesses domestic energy-efficiency levels. Ireland is a useful case study as it demonstrates the highest variations in seasonal mortality and morbidity in northern Europe, both of which are associated with fuel poverty. Ireland is also experiencing extreme difficulties meeting its environmental emissions targets in light of recent spectacular economic growth. Reducing fuel poverty would lower energy-related emissions, assisting policy makers achieve these challenging targets. Furthermore, little empirical research has been undertaken on fuel poverty in Ireland. This paper identifies key social groups at risk by conducting detailed socio-economic and socio-demographic analyses. The relationship between fuel poverty and adverse housing conditions (damp, condensation) is also examined. Moreover, the reasons behind householders not investing in energy-saving measures are reported. The results show that Ireland suffers from similar levels of fuel poverty as the UK, with low-income households suffering the greatest. The key policy implications are outlined.},

However, the Green Deal proposals have the potential to generate financial risk, due to a possible overestimation of the energy savings arising from retrofit measures. This paper proposes a framework for handling the uncertainties associated with the prediction of these energy savings, as well as demonstrating how decisions can be made in the face of the uncertainties involved in the retrofit analysis of a housing stock. The proposed framework is applied to a case study set of dwellings and it is seen that a limited range of measures will be cost-effective under the Green Deal proposals for these dwellings; as a result, subsidies will be required if higher impact measures are to be considered viable. Finally, however, it is also seen that the monetary value of additional societal benefits, such as reduced carbon emissions and improved thermal comfort, is likely to more than outweigh the cost of any subsidies.},

In order to do this, we propose performing a finite collection of additional Bayesian analyses under alternative collections of prior and likelihood modelling judgements that we may also view as representative of our prior knowledge and the problem structure, and use these to compute posterior belief assessments for key quantities of interest. We show that these assessments are closer to our true underlying beliefs than the original Bayesian analysis and use the temporal sure preference principle to establish a probabilistic relationship between our true posterior judgements, our posterior belief assessment and our original Bayesian analysis to make this precise. We exploit second order exchangeability in order to generalise our approach to situations where there are infinitely many alternative Bayesian analyses we might consider as informative for our true judgements so that the method remains tractable even in these cases. We argue that posterior belief assessment is a tractable and powerful alternative to robust Bayesian analysis. We describe a methodology for computing posterior belief assessments in even the most complex of statistical models and illustrate with an example of calibrating an expensive ocean model in order to quantify uncertainty about global mean temperature in the real ocean.},

	abstract = {Energy poverty is a growing societal challenge that puts the welfare of many European citizens at risk. Several different indicators have been developed with the objective of assessing this phenomenon. The aim of this work is to develop a novel high-resolution spatial scale composite index, focusing on space heating and cooling, to map energy poor regions and identify hotspots for local action. The proposed index (EPVI) combines socio-economic indicators of the population (AIAM sub-index) with building’s characteristics and energy performance (EPG sub-index). The method was tested for all 3092 civil parishes of Portugal and could be potentially replicated at Pan European scale. Results show a higher prevalence of significative EPVIs in the inland region and the islands, particularly in rural civil parishes. Although cooling EPVIs are generally higher, heating may be a more significant issue in terms of energy demand and health hazard. Energy poverty vulnerability assessment at such a disaggregated regional scale could bridge the gap between common overall country analyses and local-scale initiatives targeting vulnerable households. The outcomes of this paper support national and local energy efficiency policies and instruments while fostering better assessments and enabling local actions for tackling this problem.},

Effective policies to dramatically expand modern energy access need to be grounded in a robust information-base.

This paper reviews the relevant literature, and discusses the adequacy and applicability of existing instruments to measure energy poverty. Drawing on those insights, it proposes a new composite index to measure energy poverty. Both the associated methodology and initial results for several African countries are discussed. Whereas most existing indicators and composite indices focus on assessing the access to energy, or the degree of development related to energy, our new index – the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI) – focuses on the deprivation of access to modern energy services. It captures both the incidence and intensity of energy poverty, and provides a new tool to support policy-making.},

The reported UHI impacts showed strong intercity variations with an increase of cooling energy consumption from 10\% to 120\% and a decrease of heating energy consumption from 3\% to 45\%. The UHI impacts also showed clear intra-city variations with stronger impacts in urban center than that in urban periphery.

Increasing residential energy efficiency is a strategic fuel poverty intervention. However, the absence of easily accessible household energy data impedes effective targeting of energy efficiency programs. This paper uses publicly available data, bottom-up modeling and small-area estimation techniques to predict the mean census block group residential heating energy use intensity (EUI), an energy efficiency proxy, in Kansas City, Missouri. Results mapped using geographic information systems (GIS) and statistical analysis, show disparities in the relationship between heating EUI and spatial, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic block group characteristics. Block groups with lower median incomes, a greater percentage of households below poverty, a greater percentage of racial/ethnic minority headed-households, and a larger percentage of adults with less than a high school education were, on average, less energy efficient (higher EUIs). Results also imply that racial segregation, which continues to influence urban housing choices, exposes Black and Hispanic households to increased fuel poverty vulnerability. Lastly, the spatial concentration and demographics of vulnerable block groups suggest proactive, area- and community-based targeting of energy efficiency assistance programs may be more effective than existing self-referral approaches.},

A warning system is only useful if well defined and thus understood by stakeholders. However, most operational warning systems are heuristic: not formally or transparently defined. Bayesian decision theory provides a framework for issuing warnings under uncertainty but has not been fully exploited. Here, a decision theoretic framework is proposed for hazard warnings. The framework allows any number of warning levels and future states of nature, and a mathematical model for constructing the necessary loss functions for both generic and specific end-users is described. The approach is illustrated using one-day ahead warnings of daily severe precipitation over the UK, and compared to the current decision tool used by the UK Met Office. A probability model is proposed to predict precipitation, given ensemble forecast information, and loss functions are constructed for two generic stakeholders: an end-user and a forecaster. Results show that the Met Office tool issues fewer high-level warnings compared with our system for the generic end-user, suggesting the former may not be suitable for risk averse end-users. In addition, raw ensemble forecasts are shown to be unreliable and result in higher losses from warnings.},

In addition, analysis based on geographical spread of energy poverty reveals that eastern states and north-eastern states are more vulnerable in terms of energy poverty, hence requires strategic policy actions at all layers of governance.

	abstract = {The production of synthetic datasets has been proposed as a statistical disclosure control solution to generate public use files out of protected data, and as a tool to create "augmented datasets" to serve as input for micro-simulation models. Synthetic data have become an important instrument for ex-ante assessments of policy impact. The performance and acceptability of such a tool relies heavily on the quality of the synthetic populations, i.e., on the statistical similarity between the synthetic and the true population of interest. Multiple approaches and tools have been developed to generate synthetic data. These approaches can be categorized into three main groups: synthetic reconstruction, combinatorial optimization, and model-based generation. We provide in this paper a brief overview of these approaches, and introduce simPop, an open source data synthesizer. simPop is a user-friendly R package based on a modular object-oriented concept. It provides a highly optimized S4 class implementation of various methods, including calibration by iterative proportional fitting and simulated annealing, and modeling or data fusion by logistic regression. We demonstrate the use of simPop by creating a synthetic population of Austria, and report on the utility of the resulting data. We conclude with suggestions for further development of the package.},

We propose a general framework for the production of small area statistics that is governed by the principle of parsimony and is based on three broadly defined stages, namely specification, analysis and adaptation, and evaluation. Emphasis is given to the interaction between a user of small area statistics and the statistician in specifying the target geography and parameters in the light of the available data. Model-free and model-dependent methods are described with a focus on model selection and testing, model diagnostics and adaptations such as use of data transformations. Uncertainty measures and the use of model and design-based simulations for method evaluation are also at the centre of the paper. We illustrate the application of the proposed framework by using real data for the estimation of non-linear deprivation indicators. Linear statistics, e.g. averages, are included as special cases of the general framework.},

Geolocated census microdata data, however, are almost never available and are thus best simulated. In this paper, we simulate a close-to-reality population of individuals nested in households geolocated to realistic building locations. Using the R simPop package and ArcGIS, multiple realizations of a geolocated synthetic population are derived from the Namibia 2011 census 20\% microdata sample, Namibia census enumeration area boundaries, Namibia 2013 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and dozens of spatial covariates derived from publicly available datasets. Realistic household latitude-longitude coordinates are manually generated based on public satellite imagery. Simulated households are linked to latitude-longitude coordinates by identifying distinct household types with multivariate k-means analysis and modelling a probability surface for each household type using Random Forest machine learning methods. We simulate five realizations of a synthetic population in Namibia's Oshikoto region, including demographic, socioeconomic, and outcome characteristics at the level of household, woman, and child. Comparison of variables in the synthetic population were made with 2011 census 20\% sample and 2013 DHS data by primary sampling unit/enumeration area. We found that synthetic population variable distributions matched observed observations and followed expected spatial patterns. We outline a novel process to simulate a close-to-reality microdata census geolocated to realistic building locations in a low- or middle-income country setting to support spatial demographic research and survey methodological development while avoiding disclosure risk of individuals.},

In this study, two real cases of a leading company in the thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) industry are examined. Two learning algorithms-a back-propagation neural network and support vector regression-are employed for modeling, and two sample generation approaches-bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)-are employed to compare the accuracy of the models.

	abstract = {In Europe, the final energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residential and commercial building stocks account for approximately 40\% of energy and emissions. A building stock model (BSM) is a method of assessing the energy demand and GHG emissions of building stocks and developing pathways for energy and GHG emission reduction. The most common approach to building stock modeling is to construct archetypes that are taken to representing large segments of the stock. This paper introduces a new method of building stock modeling based on the generation of synthetic building stocks. By drawing on relevant research, the developed methodology uses aggregate national data and combines it with various data sources to generate a disaggregated synthetic building stock. The methodology is implemented and validated for the residential building stock of Switzerland. The results demonstrate that the energy demand and GHG emissions can vary greatly across the stock. These and other indicators vary significantly within common building stock segments that consider only few attributes such as building type and construction period. Furthermore, the results indicate a separation of the stock in terms of GHG emissions between old fossil fuel-heated buildings and new and refurbished buildings that are heated by renewable energy. Generating a disaggregated synthetic building stock allows for a discrete representation of various building states. This enables a more realistic representation of past building stock alterations, such as refurbishment, compared with commonly used archetypes, and not relying on more extensive data sources and being able to accommodate a wide variation of data types. The developed methodology can be extended in numerous manners and lays groundwork for future studies. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating occupant behavior into building performance simulation models used during the design process that is, before the actual occupants are known. It proposes the use of synthetic population data, an approach that is novel in building performance modeling although common in urban planning and public health. A simpler approach embodied in the ASHRAE Fundamentals volume is to report standard distributions of values for behavioral variables, assuming that parameters vary independently of one another when in fact many co-vary or are interdependent. An alternative approach calibrates models of occupant behavior against actual occupants in specific existing buildings, but this raises questions of transferability. Needed is a database of "generic" occupants that designers can use prospectively during the design process. This paper documents a process of combining disparate field studies of commercial buildings into a larger occupant behavior database and generating a statistically similar synthetic data set that can be shared without compromising confidentiality requirements associated with field studies. The synthetic data set successfully incorporates much of the covariance structure of the underlying field data and supports multivariate modeling. Its scope and structure necessarily serve the needs of the associated modeling framework. Cooperative and systematic sharing of data by field researchers is crucial for building large enough data sets to serve as a behaviorally-robust basis for building design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {When benchmarking RDF data management systems such as public transport route planners, system evaluation needs to happen under various realistic circumstances, which requires a wide range of datasets with different properties. Real-world datasets are almost ideal, as they offer these realistic circumstances, but they are often hard to obtain and inflexible for testing. For these reasons, synthetic dataset generators are typically preferred over real-world datasets due to their intrinsic flexibility. Unfortunately, many synthetic dataset that are generated within benchmarks are insufficiently realistic, raising questions about the generalizability of benchmark results to real-world scenarios. In order to benchmark geospatial and temporal RDF data management systems such as route planners with sufficient external validity and depth, we designed PODiGG, a highly configurable generation algorithm for synthetic public transport datasets with realistic geospatial and temporal characteristics comparable to those of their real-world variants. The algorithm is inspired by real-world public transit network design and scheduling methodologies. This article discusses the design and implementation of PODiGG and validates the properties of its generated datasets. Our findings show that the generator achieves a sufficient level of realism, based on the existing coherence metric and new metrics we introduce specifically for the public transport domain. Thereby, PODiGG provides a flexible foundation for benchmarking RDF data management systems with geospatial and temporal data.},

Indeed, these models are often unstable when they use small datasets. To solve this issue, which is particularly critical in light of the possible clinical applications of these predictive models, researchers have developed approaches such as virtual sample generation. Virtual sample generation significantly improves learning and classification performance when working with small samples. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of the proposed virtual sample generation to overcome the small sample size problem, which is a feature of the automated detection of a neurodevelopmental disorder, namely autism spectrum disorder. Results show that our method enhances diagnostic accuracy from 84\%-95\% using virtual samples generated on the basis of five actual clinical samples. The present findings show the feasibility of using the proposed technique to improve classification performance even in cases of clinical samples of limited size. Accounting for concerns in relation to small sample sizes, our technique represents a meaningful step forward in terms of pattern recognition methodology, particularly when it is applied to diagnostic classifications of neurodevelopmental disorders. Besides, the proposed technique has been tested with other available benchmark datasets. The experimental outcomes showed that the accuracy of the classification that used virtual samples was superior to the one that used original training data without virtual samples.},

	abstract = {Limited sample sizes can lead to spurious modeling findings in biomedical research. The objective of this work is to present a new method to generate synthetic populations (SPs) from limited samples using matched case-control data (n = 180 pairs), considered as two separate limited samples. SPs were generated with multivariate kernel density estimations (KDEs) with unconstrained bandwidth matrices. We included four continuous variables and one categorical variable for each individual. Bandwidth matrices were determined with Differential Evolution (DE) optimization by covariance comparisons. Four synthetic samples (n = 180) were derived from their respective SPs. Similarity between observed samples with synthetic samples was compared assuming their empirical probability density functions (EPDFs) were similar. EPDFs were compared with the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) test statistic based on the Kernel Two-Sample Test. To evaluate similarity within a modeling context, EPDFs derived from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scores and residuals were summarized with the distance to the model in X-space (DModX) as additional comparisons. Four SPs were generated from each sample. The probability of selecting a replicate when randomly constructing synthetic samples (n = 180) was infinitesimally small. MMD tests indicated that the observed sample EPDFs were similar to the respective synthetic EPDFs. For the samples, PCA scores and residuals did not deviate significantly when compared with their respective synthetic samples. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by producing synthetic data at the individual level, statistically similar to the observed samples. The methodology coupled KDE with DE optimization and deployed novel similarity metrics derived from PCA. This approach could be used to generate larger-sized synthetic samples. To develop this approach into a research tool for data exploration purposes, additional evaluation with increased dimensionality is required. Moreover, given a fully specified population, the degree to which individuals can be discarded while synthesizing the respective population accurately will be investigated. When these objectives are addressed, comparisons with other techniques such as bootstrapping will be required for a complete evaluation.},

	abstract = {Microsimulation models that simulate travel demand at the level of individual travelers have been gaining increasing interest among practitioners. Transportation planning agencies across the country are steadily migrating to activity-based microsimulation models, which provide considerable flexibility when testing policy scenarios. Generating a synthetic population is the first step in the application of any activity-based model system and has therefore been a topic of extensive research in the activity based modeling arena. Several researchers have developed population synthesizers that can generate synthetic populations and can match household- and person-level constraints at a specified geographic resolution (e.g., a census block group). However, although information for some control variables may be available at the specified spatial resolution, information for other control variables may be available only at a more aggregate spatial resolution. Ignoring control variables at different levels of spatial resolution could result in the generation of a synthetic population that would not be representative of the underlying population. However, there has been limited progress in the development of synthetic population generators that are capable of accommodating control variables at multiple spatial resolutions. This paper proposes a robust approach to control for constraints at multiple geographic resolutions when generating a synthetic population. The method is an extension of the iterative proportional updating algorithm previously proposed and implemented by the authors. A case study demonstrating the efficacy of the enhanced algorithm is presented.},

	abstract = {Micro-simulation travel demand and land use models require a synthetic population, which consists of a set of agents characterized by demographic and socio-economic attributes. Two main families of population synthesis techniques can be distinguished: (a) fitting methods (iterative proportional fitting, updating) and (b) combinatorial optimization methods. During the last few years, a third outperforming family of population synthesis procedures has emerged, i.e., Markov process-based methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations. In this paper, an extended Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based approach is presented, which can serve as a better alternative than the existing methods. The approach is characterized by a great flexibility and efficiency in terms of data preparation and model training. The HMM is able to reproduce the structural configuration of a given population from an unlimited number of micro-samples and a marginal distribution. Only one marginal distribution of the considered population can be used as a boundary condition to "guide" the synthesis of the whole population. Model training and testing are performed using the Survey on the Workforce of 2013 and the Belgian National Household Travel Survey of 2010. Results indicate that the HMM method captures the complete heterogeneity of the micro-data contrary to standard fitting approaches. The method provides accurate results as it is able to reproduce the marginal distributions and their corresponding multivariate joint distributions with an acceptable error rate (i.e., SRSME=0.54 for 6 synthesized attributes). Furthermore, the HMM outperforms IPF for small sample sizes, even though the amount of input data is less than that for IPF. Finally, simulations show that the HMM can merge information provided by multiple data sources to allow good population estimates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Latent choice set models that account for probabilistic consideration of choice alternatives during decision making have long existed. The Manski model that assumes a two-stage representation of decision making has served as the standard workhorse model for discrete choice modeling with latent choice sets. However, estimation of the Manski model is not always feasible because evaluation of the likelihood function in the Manski model requires enumeration of all possible choice sets leading to explosion for moderate and large choice sets. In this study, we propose a new group of implicit choice set generation models that can approximate the Manski model while retaining linear complexity with respect to the choice set size. We examined the performance of the models proposed in this study using synthetic data. The simulation results indicate that the approximations proposed in this study perform considerably well in terms of replicating the Manski model parameters. We subsequently used these implicit choice set models to understand latent choice set considerations in household auto ownership decisions of resident population in the Southern California region. The empirical results confirm our hypothesis that certain segments of households may only consider a subset of auto ownership levels while making decisions regarding the number of cars to own. The results not only underscore the importance of using latent choice models for modeling household auto ownership decisions but also demonstrate the applicability of the approximations proposed in this study to estimate these latent choice set models.

The contingency tables of the generated populations match external controls on the individual and household levels while exhibiting far greater variety in composition than existing approaches can offer. The method involves a two-step approach. The first consists of a procedure based on Gibbs sampling, which has only recently been applied to population generation in transportation modeling and is generically called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For this work, the model was generalized, and an extension was developed, hierarchical MCMC, which was able to generate a hierarchical structure. The second step, a postprocessing step, uses generalized raking (GR), which reweights the output from hierarchical MCMC to perfectly satisfy known marginal control totals on the individual and household levels. The application input data a demographic sample and some known marginals from Singapore added further complexities to the problem, which had not yet been explored in the current literature. Despite data challenges, consecutively applying the methods above produced realistic synthetic populations. Results confirm their goodness of fit and their generated hierarchical structures.},

	abstract = {The advent of microsimulation in the transportation sector has created the need for extensive disaggregated data concerning the population whose behavior is modeled. Because of the cost of collecting this data and the existing privacy regulations, this need is often met by the creation of a synthetic population on the basis of aggregate data. Although several techniques for generating such a population are known, they suffer from a number of limitations. The first is the need for a sample of the population for which fully disaggregated data must be collected, although such samples may not exist or may not be financially feasible. The second limiting assumption is that the aggregate data used must be consistent, a situation that is most unusual because these data often come from different sources and are collected, possibly at different moments, using different protocols. The paper presents a new synthetic population generator in the class of the Synthetic Reconstruction methods, whose objective is to obviate these limitations. It proceeds in three main successive steps: generation of individuals, generation of household type's joint distributions, and generation of households by gathering individuals. The main idea in these generation steps is to use data at the most disaggregated level possible to define joint distributions, from which individuals and households are randomly drawn. The method also makes explicit use of both continuous and discrete optimization and uses the χ² metric to estimate distances between estimated and generated distributions. The new generator is applied for constructing a synthetic population of approximately 10,000,000 individuals and 4,350,000 households localized in the 589 municipalities of Belgium. The statistical quality of the generated population is discussed using criteria extracted from the literature, and it is shown that the new population generator produces excellent results.},

Households are generated by selection of households from the associated PUMS according to these proportions. The tables of demographic proportions which are exploited here to make household selections from the PUMS may be used in traditional modeling. The procedures are validated by creating pseudo census tracts from PUMS samples and considering the joint distribution of the size of households and the number of vehicles in the households. It is shown that the joint distributions created by these methods do not differ substantially from the true values.

	abstract = {Background
Many national cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor management guidelines now recommend that drug treatment decisions should be informed primarily by patients’ multi-variable predicted risk of CVD, rather than on the basis of single risk factor thresholds. To investigate the potential impact of treatment guidelines based on CVD risk thresholds at a national level requires individual level data representing the multi-variable CVD risk factor profiles for a country’s total adult population. As these data are seldom, if ever, available, we aimed to create a synthetic population, representing the joint CVD risk factor distributions of the adult New Zealand population.

Methods and results
A synthetic population of 2,451,278 individuals, representing the actual age, gender, ethnicity and social deprivation composition of people aged 30–84 years who completed the 2013 New Zealand census was generated using Monte Carlo sampling. Each ‘synthetic’ person was then probabilistically assigned values of the remaining cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors required for predicting their CVD risk, based on data from the national census national hospitalisation and drug dispensing databases and a large regional cohort study, using Monte Carlo sampling and multiple imputation. Where possible, the synthetic population CVD risk distributions for each non-demographic risk factor were validated against independent New Zealand data sources.

Conclusions
We were able to develop a synthetic national population with realistic multi-variable CVD risk characteristics. The construction of this population is the first step in the development of a micro-simulation model intended to investigate the likely impact of a range of national CVD risk management strategies that will inform CVD risk management guideline updates in New Zealand and elsewhere.},

Despite a rapid growth in the rate of electrification, 9\% of electrified Indian households in our six sampled states continued to use kerosene as their primary lighting fuel in 2018. This appears as a puzzle considering the benefits of electric lights. Using a panel survey of rural households in six states in India, we examine why some grid-connected households primarily used kerosene lamps for illumination. We use a logistic regression model to test our hypothesis regarding the relationship between primary lighting choices and electricity quality. The results show that household primary lighting choices are correlated with nighttime duration of electricity service, daytime duration of electricity service, and the number of days without any electricity connection, at the 99\% confidence level. Among these three factors, nighttime duration of electricity service has the greatest impact. To further promote the use of electric lights, intensive schemes to improve electricity quality are needed.},

In 2011, 200 million people in urban Indian households were considered to live in slums. In order to address and create slum development programmes and poverty alleviation methods, it is necessary to understand the needs of these communities. Therefore, we require data with high granularity in the Indian context. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of highly granular data at the level of individual slums. We collected the data presented in this paper in partnership with the slum dwellers in order to overcome the challenges such as validity and efficacy of self reported data. Our survey of Bangalore covered 36 slums across the city. The slums were chosen based on stratification criteria, which included geographical location of the slum, whether the slum was resettled or rehabilitated, notification status of the slum, the size of the slum and the religious profile.

However, existing tutorials tend to be at a level of abstraction largely impenetrable by non-technicians. This tutorial aims to help beginners understand key concepts by working through important but often omitted derivations carefully and explicitly, with a focus on linking the mathematics with a practical computation solution for a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM)—one of the most widely used BNP methods. Abstract concepts are made explicit and concrete to non-technical readers by working through the theory that gives rise to them. A publicly accessible computer program written in the statistical language R is explained line-by-line to help readers understand the computation algorithm. The algorithm is also linked to a construction method called the Chinese Restaurant Process in an accessible tutorial in this journal (Gershman and Blei, 2012). The overall goals are to help readers understand more fully the theory and application so that they may apply BNP methods in their own work and leverage the technical details in this tutorial to develop novel methods.},

	abstract = {Synthetic population is a key input to agent-based urban/transportation microsimulation models. The objective of population synthesis is to reproduce the underlying statistical properties of real population based on available microsamples and marginal distributions. However, characterizing the joint associations among a large set of attributes is challenging because of the curse of dimensionality, in particular when attributes are organized in a hierarchical household-individual structure. In this paper, we use a hierarchical mixture model to characterize the joint distribution of both household and individual attributes. Based on this model, we propose a framework of generating representative household structures in population synthesis. The framework integrates three models: (1) probabilistic tensor factorization, (2) multilevel latent class model, and (3) rejection sampling. With this framework, one can generalize not only the associations of within- and cross-level attributes, but also reproduce structural relationships among household members (e.g., husband-wife). As a case study, we implement this framework based on the household interview travel survey (HITS) data of Singapore, and then use the inferred model to generate a synthetic population pool. This model demonstrates great potential in reproducing the underlying statistical distribution of real population. The generated synthetic population can serve as a replacement for census in developing agent-based models, with privacy and confidentiality being protected and preserved.},

	abstract = {The residential housing sector is a major consumer of energy accounting for approximately one third of carbon emissions in the United Kingdom. Achieving a sustainable, low-carbon infrastructure necessitates a reduced and more efficient use of domestic energy supplies. Energy service companies offer an alternative to traditional providers, which supply a single utility product to satisfy the unconstrained demand of end users, and have been identified as a potentially important actor in sustainable future economies. An agent-based model is developed to examine the potential of energy service companies to contribute to the large scale upgrading of household energy efficiency, which would ultimately lead to a more sustainable and secure energy infrastructure. The migration of households towards energy service companies is described by an attractiveness array, through which potential customers can evaluate the future benefits, in terms of household energy costs, of changing provider. It is shown that self-financing is a limiting factor to the widespread upgrading of residential energy efficiency. Greater reductions in household energy costs could be achieved by committing to longer term contracts, allowing upgrade costs to be distributed over greater time intervals. A steadily increasing cost of future energy usage lends an element of stability to the market, with energy service companies displaying the ability to retain customers on contract expiration. The model highlights how a greater focus on the provision of energy services, as opposed to consumable products, presents a viable approach to reducing future energy costs and usage.},

In recent years, efforts have been made to develop more detailed occupancy-related input data for building performance simulation. For instance, instead of using standard occupancy schedules or simple rule-based behavioral models, stochastic formalisms have been proposed to more realistically capture occupants' patterns of presence and behavior in buildings. Specifically, agent-based modelling has been suggested to provide an adequate tool to capture the complexity and dynamics of building occupants, both as individuals and as groups. In this context, the present paper entails a brief discussion of agent-based modeling followed by a concise review of a number of recent publications reporting on the application of agent-based modeling in the built environment domain (especially regarding buildings' energy and indoor-environmental performance). The paper concludes with remarks on the future prospects of agent-based modelling in building-related applications.},

	abstract = {High penetration of distributed technologies would call for a different way to manage electricity reliability for semi-independent households. One option could be to allow customers to withdraw power from the grid when their home system fails. This behavior, however, could constitute an existential threat for utilities: if consumers use the network less, and continue to pay according to their usage, the utility might be unable to recover its costs. This paper investigates whether the creation of a reliability insurance market would help to deal with these concerns. We propose a business model where utilities offer insurance to semi-independent, yet risk averse households, against the prospect of a blackout, when a pay as you go system is no longer available. With the use of an Agent Based Model, we test if contracts from this market can converge into a theoretical optimal contract where bounded perception of risks and losses impact the price of insurance and potential revenues of utilities. We find that such a market could exist as consumers efficiently transfer all or a portion of their risk to the utility, based on their willingness to pay and risk profiles, which allows them to avoid blackouts at the margin.},

	abstract = {Rapid urbanization, climate change and energy security warrant a more detailed understanding of how cities today consume energy. Agent-based, integrated microsimulation models of urban systems provide an excellent platform to accomplish this task, as they can capture both the short- and long-term decisions of firms and households which directly affect urban energy consumption. This paper presents the current effort towards developing an urban energy model for the Integrated Land Use, Transportation, Environment (ILUTE) modelling system. As a first step, a model for the residential space heating system evolution of the Greater Toronto–Hamilton Area was developed. A bottom-up approach, where individual uses are aggregated, was then employed to estimate the region’s space heating demand. Conventional bottom-up methodologies often suffer from insensitivity to either technological or behavioral factors. It is argued that coupling a discrete choice model with building energy simulation software solves this problem. A joint logit model of heating fuel and equipment choice was developed and estimated using Toronto household microdata. The HOT2000 software was then used to compute individual dwelling unit space heating use. The entire residential energy analysis was performed in tandem with the housing market and demographic evolution processes. This allows the endogenous formation of the required inputs as well as adherence to the core ILUTE framework of integrated modelling. This residential space heating model is a first step towards a comprehensive urban energy end-use model. Further steps include developing similar models for other residential end-uses, such electricity and hot water consumption, as well as extensions to the commercial and transportation sectors. The entire effort aims to introduce an alternate methodology to modelling urban energy consumption that takes advantage of agent-based microsimulation to enhance and address issues with current approaches.},

Year 2030 household energy demands and GHG emissions estimates are compared under five different land use and transport policy scenarios. Application of an urban growth boundary provided the lowest increase in overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and GHG emissions, while network additions resulted in the highest rates of increase. Average energy consumption per household are estimated to fall over time (by 11–19\% depending on the scenario), but the region’s overall energy consumption is estimated to increase dramatically – by nearly 88\% in terms of home energy consumption (in the base scenario) and 108\% in the transport sector, relative to the 2005 base-year scenario. Such increases are considerably higher than proposed GHG targets, presenting a serious energy and emissions challenge for Austin as well as other U.S. regions.},

Accurate and automatic classification (eg, normal/abnormal or malignant/benign) has a variety of applications such as automatic decision making and is known to be very challenging. In this research, we address this problem by investigating the effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods for statistical bounded mixture models. Indeed, a novel approach termed as Bayesian learning for bounded generalized Gaussian mixture models is developed. The consideration of bounded mixture models is encouraged by their capability to take into account the nature of the data that is compactly supported. Furthermore, the consideration of Bayesian inference is more attractive compared to frequentist reasoning. In this work, we address main issues related to accurate data classification such as the effective estimation of the model's parameters and the selection of the optimal model complexity. Moreover, the problem of over- or under-fitting is treated by taking into account the uncertainty through introducing prior information about the model's parameters. A comparative study between different Gaussian-based models is also performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Experiments have been conducted on challenging biomedical image datasets that involve retinal images for diabetic retinopathy detection and mammograms for breast cancer detection. Obtained results are encouraging and show the benefits of our Bayesian framework.},

Owing to the high cost of transition policies, the efficacy of these policies must be analyzed to identify the most effective policy. The implementation of transition policies, however, could dynamically influence people's perception and behavior, which then changes the landscape of adoption barriers. Furthermore, even a seemingly successful policy may fail when a certain pathway of uncertainties emerges in the future. To address these concerns, we integrated agent-based modeling, exploratory modeling, and diffusion of innovation theory into the exploratory model-based diffusion analysis approach. This approach evaluates the policy's performance, explores changes in the relative importance of different adoption barriers, and identifies policy vulnerabilities, i.e., scenarios leading to policy failures. We tested this approach on four NGV transition policies targeting three adoption barriers. We found that the importance of adoption barriers and the critical uncertainties upon the implemented policies. The social–behavioral barrier predominates under current conditions, whereas the economic factor becomes more relevant when all policies are executed. Understanding the changes in adoption barriers and policy vulnerabilities will help decision-makers to prepare additional measures that ensure a successful transition.},

	abstract = {Prior research has shown that land use patterns and the spatial configurations of cities have a significant impact on residential energy demand. Given the pressing issues surrounding energy security and climate change, there is renewed interest in developing and retrofitting cities to make them more energy efficient. Yet deriving micro-scale residential energy footprints of metropolitan areas is challenging because high resolution data from energy providers is generally unavailable. In this study, a bottom-up model is proposed to estimate residential energy demand using datasets that are commonly available in the United States. The model applies novel machine learning methods to match records in the Residential Energy Consumption Survey with Public Use Microdata samples. This matching and machine learning produce a synthetic household energy distribution at a neighborhood scale. The model was tested and validated with data from the Atlanta metropolitan region to demonstrate its application and promise.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the distributional effects of France's recently introduced carbon tax. Using a microsimulation model built on a representative sample of the French population from 2012, it simulates the taxes levied on each household's consumption of energy for housing and transport. Without revenue recycling, the carbon tax is regressive and increases fuel poverty. From a policy perspective, this finding indicates that the question of fuel poverty cannot be ignored in the quest for a fair ecological transition. It proposes that some of the revenues from the carbon tax should be redistributed to households. Different designs of cash transfer to support households are then compared. The results show that the inequities of the carbon tax could be offset at reasonable cost relative to total carbon tax revenues. However, adjusting the design of cash transfers to criteria other than income level does not diminish the cost of compensating households. The benefits of finely adjusting cash transfers may therefore be somewhat limited. Most notably, the results show that targeting revenue recycling at low-income households would help to reduce fuel poverty substantially. This study therefore indicates that carbon taxation actually provides an opportunity to finance ambitious policies to fight fuel poverty.},

	abstract = {Microsimulation is a class of Urban Building Energy Modeling techniques in which energetic interactions between buildings are explicitly resolved. Examples include SUNtool and CitySim+, both of which employ a sophisticated radiosity-based algorithm to solve for radiation exchange. The computational cost of this algorithm increases in proportion to the square of the number of surfaces of which an urban scene is comprised. To simulate large scenes, of the order of 10,000 to 1,000,000 surfaces, it is desirable to divide the scene to distribute the simulation task. However, this partitioning is not trivial as the energy-related interactions create uneven inter-dependencies between computing nodes. To this end, we describe in this paper two approaches (K-means and Greedy Community Detection algorithms) for partitioning urban scenes, and subsequently performing building energy microsimulation using CitySim+ on a distributed memory High-Performance Computing Cluster. To compare the performance of these partitioning techniques, we propose two measures evaluating the extent to which the obtained clusters exploit data locality. We show that our approach using Greedy Community Detection performs well in terms of exploiting data locality and reducing inter-dependencies among sub-scenes, but at the expense of a higher data preparation cost and algorithm run-time.},

To understand the change in the number of fuel poverty households, we have developed a microsimulation tool that takes into account the three predominant factors in the notion of fuel poverty, that is, household resources, energy prices and dwelling quality. Our tool includes three multiple linear models for estimating the following: 1. disposable income; 2. energy expenditure; and 3. the probability of performing a thermal renovation. We test our model with real values for variation in energy prices and variation in disposable income and a realistic number of housing renovations. The model is calibrated to the two last French national housing survey, matches the data very well and closely reproduces the number in fuel poverty in the 2012/2014 period. We not only evaluate fuel poverty in France in 2018 but also study the effects of variations in the unemployment rate, energy prices and number of thermal renovations.},

But it has become apparent that policies interact across space and time and need to be modelled together. The first urban and regional models were aggregate in space and comparative-static in time. More recently, new data sources and computing techniques have stimulated ever more disaggregation in space and time culminating in agent-based, activitybased microsimulation despite its significant even larger data needs, computing requirements and theoretical problems. This paper argues for models that are instead multi-level and multi-scale in space, time and subsystems. This paper starts with a brief history of urban models and the experience of the authors with the highly integrated urban microsimulation model ILUMASS. Based on this experience, it discusses the benefits and pitfalls of microsimulation and proposes a three-level model system of spatial development, ranging from the European to the local level. The paper closes with new challenges for urban models posed by climate change, energy scarcity, new social problems and new technologies and argues that they make multi-level, multi-scale models even more important and illustrates this by ongoing work with the multi-level model for cities in the Ruhr.},

	abstract = {This paper presents microsimulation of life-stage transitions and residential location transition processes within a life-oriented agent-based integrated Transport Land Use and Energy (iTLE) modeling system. The iTLE assumes that individuals and households are the agents, and parcels are the objects. It is conceptualized following the life-course perspectives and theories to address the evolution of multi-domain decision interactions over the life-course of the agents. Residential location is simulated as a two-stage process of residential mobility, and location choice. Life-stage simulation includes aging, death, birth, out-migration, in-migration, and household formation. The iTLE is implemented at a yearly time-step from 2006 to 2021 for Halifax, Canada. A 100\% synthetic population is generated for the base year 2006, which shows a SRMSE value of 0.37 and APE measures of less than 5\% for 89\% of the DAs. The simulation results are validated with the 2011 Census information. The validation results suggest that the iTLE generates reasonably satisfactory population estimates. For example, around 52\% of the DAs show an APE value of less than 30\%, and 37\% of the DAs show a difference in the number of households of less than ±50. The predicted results regarding the spatio-temporal evolution of Halifax suggests an increase of around 14\% population in 2021 compared to 2007. Younger population residing closer to the CBD are predicted to be more frequent movers than older population residing farther away from the CBD. Higher proportions of the households are predicted in the locations within 25 km from the CBD over the years. Proportion of households in these high density neighborhoods are predicted to increase from 68\% in 2007 to 71\% in 2021. In 2021, a higher density of single person households are predicted in the urban core. Density is predicted to be more variable and skewed towards suburban neighborhoods as household composition changes through marriage and child birth.},

The main idea is to utilize the support vector machine (SVM) approach to model the CLR problem by using the SVM for regression to approximate each cluster. This new formulation of the CLR problem is represented as an unconstrained nonsmooth optimization problem, where we minimize a difference of two convex (DC) functions. To solve this problem, a method based on the combination of the incremental algorithm and the double bundle method for DC optimization is designed. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the reliability of the new formulation for CLR and the efficiency of the proposed method. The results show that the SVM approach is suitable for solving CLR problems, especially, when there are outliers in data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in the statistical forecasting of the daily mean PM10 concentration. Hourly concentrations of PM10 have been measured in the city of Rouen, in Haute-Normandie, France. Located at northwest of Paris, near the south side of Manche sea and heavily industrialised. We consider three monitoring stations reflecting the diversity of situations: an urban background station, a traffic station and an industrial station near the cereal harbour of Rouen. We have focused our attention on data for the months that register higher values, from December to March, on years 2004–2009. The models are obtained from the winter days of the four seasons 2004/2005 to 2007/2008 (training data) and then the forecasting performance is evaluated on the winter days of the season 2008/2009 (test data). We show that it is possible to accurately forecast the daily mean concentration by fitting a function of meteorological predictors and the average concentration measured on the previous day. The values of observed meteorological variables are used for fitting the models and are also considered for the test data. We have compared the forecasts produced by three different methods: persistence, generalized additive nonlinear models and clusterwise linear regression models. This last method gives very impressive results and the end of the paper tries to analyze the reasons of such a good behavior.},

The method simultaneously estimates the models relating preference to product dimensions within each cluster, as well as the parameters indicating the degree of membership of subjects in these clusters.

Using synthetic data, the performance of the method is evaluated according to computational requirements, parameter recovery, and data reproduction. Comparisons with the clusterwise regression approach of DeSarbo, Oliver and Rangaswamy (1989) and Hagerty's (1985) optimal weighting method for conjoint analysis are given, as well as an application to the analysis of preferences for meat products.

Besides, cities from both the most rapidly developing countries and the most-developed regions are overwhelmingly studied, while Central European cities are underrepresented in the current literature. Based on the previously mentioned frames, this study aims to fill the scientific gap by assessing the urban sustainability of Budapest, Hungary, on district level by using indicator method. Selected and partly constructed variables reflect the significant features of Budapest regarding environmental, social, and economic sustainability issues, thus altogether 30 indicators contributed to revealing major differences between districts in terms of their relative sustainability performance. The indicators were weighed by applying Guilford's weighting methodology; thus, dimension-level weights were not applied in order to understand better the hidden cause-effects between dimensions and overall sustainability performances. After the evaluation of the results the followings can be stated: firstly, a relevant geographical slope can be drawn regarding the overall sustainability of the districts grouped into Buda- and Pest-side units; secondly, social and economic dimensions determine the overall sustainability score in a more robust way compared to the relative role of environmental sustainability issues.},

In this article, we show that the minimization of this criterion makes no effort to distinguish the error explained by the within-cluster regression models from the error explained by the clustering process. In some cases, most of the variation in the response variable is explained by clustering the objects, with little additional benefit provided by the within-cluster regression models. Accordingly, there is tremendous potential for overfitting with clusterwise regression, which is demonstrated with numerical examples and simulation experiments. To guard against the misuse of clusterwise regression, we recommend a benchmarking procedure that compares the results for the observed empirical data with those obtained across a set of random permutations of the response measures. We also demonstrate the potential for overfitting via an empirical application related to the prediction of reflective judgment using high school and college performance measures.},

The objective of the study was to develop performance models for the management of urban pavement networks. Markov chains and Monte Carlo simulation were applied to account for the probabilistic nature of pavements deterioration over time, using data collected in the field. One of the advantages of this methodology is that it can be used by local agencies with scarce technical resources and historical data. Eight performance models were developed and successfully validated for asphalt and concrete pavements in humid, dry and Mediterranean climates with different functional hierarchies. The resulting models evidence the impact of design, traffic demand, climate and construction standards on urban pavements performance. Predicted service life of asphalt and concrete pavements in primary networks are consistent with design standards. However, pavements in secondary and local networks present shorter and longer service life compared to design life, respectively. Climate is a relevant factor for asphalt pavements, where higher deterioration was observed compared to that expected. Opposite to this, no relevant differences between design and performance can be attributed to climate in concrete pavements.},

Previous studies using CR approach have a few limitations: (1) the explanatory power of variables used in the analyses was not tested; (2) the approach could not find the optimal number of clusters; (3) the objective function was to minimise the sum of squared errors, which is not the best to seek for the optimal number of clusters; (4) the model functional form was restricted to be either linear or nonlinear. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a generalised mathematical programme and solution algorithm within the CR framework. Bayesian Information Criteria was used as the objective function. The proposed approach explored all possible combinations of potential significant explanatory variables to select the best model specification. The potential multicollinearity issues in the models were addressed if required. Both linear and nonlinear functional forms were estimated using a large dataset in Nevada. Predictive accuracy of the resultant models was evaluated using root-mean-square error (RMSE), normalised RMSE, and mean absolute errors. The results showed that the nonlinear models were more accurate than the linear models in estimating present serviceability index.},

Energy efficiency interventions offers a low-cost opportunity to achieve its climate goals. Though the Indian government has rolled out several energy efficiency schemes, the rate of decrease in energy intensity is lower than expectations. One of the desirable areas for intervention is influencing energy usage in households, which consumes a quarter of the total energy generated in India. The study analyzes energy usage behavior in households, using a mix of primary and secondary techniques. Key findings include seasonal consumption trends correlating with climatic parameters, use of inefficient equipment and rebound effect. Policy prescriptions include peak load clipping techniques like weatherization of homes, display of real-time consumption, rationalization of tariffs and expanded criteria for selecting equipment under ‘Star Rating Scheme’. The findings may be considered to improve energy policies towards influencing consumer behavior in India.},

Early innovations were proposed by Good (1953, 1956, 1965) for smoothing proportions in contingency tables and by Lindley (1964) for inference about odds ratios. These approaches primarily used conjugate beta and Dirichlet priors. Altham (1969, 1971) presented Bayesian analogs of small-sample frequentist tests for 2×2 tables using such priors. An alternative approach using normal priors for logits received considerable attention in the 1970s by Leonard and others (e.g., Leonard 1972). Adopted usually in a hierarchical form, the logit-normal approach allows greater ﬂexibility and scope for generalization. The 1970s also saw considerable interest in loglinear modeling. The advent of modern computational methods since the mid-1980s has led to a growing literature on fully Bayesian analyses with models for categorical data, with main emphasis on generalized linear models such as logistic regression for binary and multi-category response variables.},

However, existing data sources to measure progress on the SDGs are often outdated or lacking appropriate disaggregation. We evaluate the value that anonymous, publicly accessible advertising data from Facebook can provide in mapping socio-economic development in two low and middle income countries, the Philippines and India. Concretely, we show that audience estimates of how many Facebook users in a given location use particular device types, such as Android vs. iOS devices, or particular connection types, such as 2G vs. 4G, provide strong signals for modeling regional variation in the Wealth Index (WI), derived from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). We further show that, surprisingly, the predictive power of these digital connectivity features is roughly equal at both the high and low ends of the WI spectrum. Finally we show how such data can be used to create gender-disaggregated predictions, but that these predictions only appear plausible in contexts with gender equal Facebook usage, such as the Philippines, but not in contexts with large gender Facebook gaps, such as India.},

This paper asks a question more directly relevant to development policy: Can non-traditional data be used to more eﬃciently target development aid? By combining rich survey data from a “big push” antipoverty program in Afghanistan with detailed mobile phone logs from program beneﬁciaries, we study the extent to which machine learning methods can accurately diﬀerentiate ultra-poor households eligible for program beneﬁts from other poor households deemed ineligible. We show that supervised learning methods leveraging mobile phone data can identify ultra-poor households as accurately as standard survey-based measures of poverty, including consumption and wealth; and that combining survey-based measures with mobile phone data produces classiﬁcations more accurate than those based on a single data source. We discuss the implications and limitations of these methods for targeting extreme poverty in marginalized populations.},

	abstract = {The link between pollution and health is commonly explored by trying to identify the dominant cause of pollution and its most significant effect on health outcomes. The use of multivariate features to describe exposure is less explored because investigating a large domain of scenarios is theoretically (i.e., interpretation of results) and technically (i.e., computational effort) challenging. In this work we explore the use of Bayesian Networks with a multivariate approach to identify the probabilistic dependence structure of the environment-health nexus. This consists of environmental factors (topography and climate), exposure levels (concentration of outdoor air pollutants), and health outcomes (mortality rates). The information is collated with regard to a data-rich study area: the English regions (UK), which incorporate environmental types that are different in character from urban to rural. We implemented a reproducible workflow in the R programming language to collate environment-health data and analyze almost 50 millions of observations making use of a graphical model (Bayesian Network) and Big Data technologies. Results show that for pollution and weather variables the model tests well in sample but also has good predictive power when tested out of sample. This is facilitated by a training/testing split in the data along time and space dimension and suggests that the model generalizes well to new regions and time periods.},

	abstract = {Background
The objective of most biomedical research is to determine an unbiased estimate of effect for an exposure on an outcome, i.e. to make causal inferences about the exposure. Recent developments in epidemiology have shown that traditional methods of identifying confounding and adjusting for confounding may be inadequate.

Discussion
The traditional methods of adjusting for "potential confounders" may introduce conditional associations and bias rather than minimize it. Although previous published articles have discussed the role of the causal directed acyclic graph approach (DAGs) with respect to confounding, many clinical problems require complicated DAGs and therefore investigators may continue to use traditional practices because they do not have the tools necessary to properly use the DAG approach. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple 6-step approach to the use of DAGs, and also to explain why the method works from a conceptual point of view.

Summary
Using the simple 6-step DAG approach to confounding and selection bias discussed is likely to reduce the degree of bias for the effect estimate in the chosen statistical model.},

	abstract = {When evaluating cognitive models based on fits to observed data (or, really, any model that has free parameters), parameter estimation is critically important. Traditional techniques like hill climbing by minimizing or maximizing a fit statistic often result in point estimates. Bayesian approaches instead estimate parameters as posterior probability distributions, and thus naturally account for the uncertainty associated with parameter estimation; Bayesian approaches also offer powerful and principled methods for model comparison. Although software applications such as WinBUGS (Lunn, Thomas, Best, \& Spiegelhalter, Statistics and Computing, 10, 325–337, 2000) and JAGS () provide “turnkey”-style packages for Bayesian inference, they can be inefficient when dealing with models whose parameters are correlated, which is often the case for cognitive models, and they can impose significant technical barriers to adding custom distributions, which is often necessary when implementing cognitive models within a Bayesian framework. A recently developed software package called Stan () can solve both problems, as well as provide a turnkey solution to Bayesian inference. We present a tutorial on how to use Stan and how to add custom distributions to it, with an example using the linear ballistic accumulator model (Brown \& Heathcote, Cognitive Psychology, 57, 153–178. doi:10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002, 2008).},

We provide evidence by using the National Sample Survey Organisation data from the 68th round (2011−12) of 87,753 households. We estimate the inequalities in access to Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and electricity usage by the households belonging to the three major disadvantaged groups in India, viz., the scheduled castes, the scheduled tribes, and the Muslims. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that, after controlling for the determinants which impinge on the households' microeconomic demand and regional supply characteristics, the households belonging to the scheduled tribe and scheduled caste communities do have significantly poorer access to LPG and electricity usage as compared to the upper caste households. The decomposition analysis of average differences in the predicted outcomes shows that it is the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe households who would appear to face most discrimination. The Muslim households too face significant inequality in accessing LPG. Policy implications of the findings are considered.},

	abstract = {Background. The use of solid fuels in household cooking contributes to indoor air pollution and is the cause of more than 4 million deaths around the world annually. Solid fuel use varies with the level of development and ranges from 0\% in high-income countries to more than 80\% in low- and middle-income countries. Three billion people (more than 40\% of the global population) are still dependent on solid fuels like firewood, dung cakes, coal, wood and agricultural residues in these countries. Objectives. The present study aims to analyze the association of certain respiratory diseases (tuberculosis (TB), acute upper respiratory infections (AURI), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and bronchial asthma) with the use of solid fuels for cooking across sociodemographic groups in India. Methods. The 71st round of the National Sample Survey, conducted in 2014, was used. In total, 54,985 inpatients who received medical treatment from any medical institution during the last 365 days preceding the survey and who reported various diseases, such as infections, cancers, blood diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases were included in the analysis. Of these inpatients, 2513 participants who reported TB, AURI, COPD and bronchial asthma were considered the dependent variables in the study. The main variable was exposure to different types of fuels used as a primary source of energy for cooking. Multinomial logistic regression was used to explain associations. Results. The results reveal a significant association between solid fuel use and respiratory diseases in India. Overall, more than 60\% of the population uses firewood and cow dung as their primary source of energy for cooking and are at a higher risk of TB, COPD and bronchial asthma. In rural areas there is a high dependence on solid fuels (80.5\%) and a higher risk of respiratory diseases compared to those residing in urban areas where people are less dependent on solid fuels (22\%). Among different socio-demographic groups, the dependence on solid fuels is highest among Scheduled Tribes (87.42\%), followed by Scheduled Castes (74.78\%) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) (a term used by the Indian government to categorize castes that face social or educational challenges) (64.47\%). Scheduled Tribes have the highest risk of TB, followed by Scheduled Castes and OBCs, respectively. Conclusions. Exposure to solid fuels for cooking increases the potential risk of TB, COPD and bronchial asthma. Access to clean and efficient fuels for cooking is essential to reduce the burden of respiratory disease. Measures are needed to increase the availability of clean fuels for households, especially among socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups, to reduce the burden of respiratory diseases in India.

Consistent with frontier settlement theory, results from multilevel modelling revealed that mountainous areas were lower on agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism and conscientiousness but higher on openness to experience. Conditional random forest algorithms confirmed mountainousness as a meaningful predictor of personality when tested against a conservative set of controls. East–west comparisons highlighted potential differences between ecological (driven by physical features) and sociocultural (driven by social norms) effects of mountainous terrain. Götz et al. find that topography is related to personality across the United States (n = 3,387,014), with people in mountainous areas being less agreeable, extraverted, neurotic and conscientious but more open.

The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more speciﬁc guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgment of multiple perspectives as complementary goals.

Few studies focused on independent association of water quantity with diarrheal diseases. This study aimed to describe the methodological protocol that adapted multidisciplinary and mixed-method research approach to assess how water usage including water quantity influences the attributable risk for diarrhea in a low-income urban community in Bangladesh. The quantitative, anthropological and microbiological approaches were threaded together to provide a greater understanding of the infrastructural, behavioral and microbial interactions to fathom the dimensions of fecal oral transmission pathways within the households. The use of the 'Choleraphone' (i.e. a mobile phone based real time diarrheal reporting system) was a contemporary approach intended to cut down on resources, reduce research fatigue and provide more accurate data compared to the 'gold standard' (i.e. visiting a household of diarrhea cases within 48 hours) for measuring diarrhea incidence. Development of methods to measure water quantity using qualitative and quantitative approach within a setting where meter water connection is rare was another unique feature of this protocol. This protocol provided guidance and insight on how multiple methods of different disciplines can be combined to enrich understanding of waterborne diseases.},

This might result in mismatches between policy objectives and the actual needs and capability of local communities. To overcome this drawback, it is crucial to obtain appropriate knowledge on the local system, which nevertheless is typically embedded in local actors’ minds in uncodified and tacit form. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have been employed to decode this kind of knowledge in a reproducible manner. However, some problems remain as to how to integrate the necessary vagueness of local actors’ heuristic with experts’ knowledge into a rational framework. The following methodology customization is proposed: • Combine the FCMs with the Discourse Analysis to obtain relevant narratives (i.e. concepts, visions, insights, etc.) needed to define system boundaries and variables. • Employ individual interviews – rather than a participatory approach – to define the causal relations among system variables. • Integrate tacit and uncodified knowledge embedded in local actors within experts’ scientific knowledge.},

Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(m d log n) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m {\textasciitilde} n and d {\textasciitilde} log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log{\textasciicircum}2 n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

This paper uses a two step approach combining predictive and descriptive analyses of the IHDS panel dataset to identify different groups of households that switched stove between 2004/5 and 2011/12. A tree-based ensemble machine learning predictive analysis identifies key determinants of a switch from biomass to non-biomass stoves. A descriptive clustering analysis is used to identify groups of stove-switching households that follow different transition pathways. There are three key findings of this study: firstly non-income determinants of stove switching do not have a linear effect on stove switching, in particular variables on time of use and appliance ownership which offer a proxy for household energy practices; secondly location specific factors including region, infrastructure availability, and dwelling quality are found to be key determinants and as a result policies must be tailored to take into account local variations; thirdly some groups of households that adopt non-biomass stoves continue using biomass and interventions should be targeted to reduce their biomass use.},

Various factors influence building energy consumption at the same time, leading to the lack of precision when identifying the individual effects of occupant behavior. This paper reports the development of a new methodology for examining the influences of occupant behavior on building energy consumption; the method is based on a basic data mining technique (cluster analysis). To deal with data inconsistencies, min–max normalization is performed as a data preprocessing step before clustering. Grey relational grades, a measure of relevancy between two factors, are used as weighted coefficients of different attributes in cluster analysis. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, the method was applied to a set of residential buildings’ measurement data. The results show that the method facilitates the evaluation of building energy-saving potential by improving the behavior of building occupants, and provides multifaceted insights into building energy end-use patterns associated with the occupant behavior. The results obtained could help prioritize efforts at modification of occupant behavior in order to reduce building energy consumption, and help improve modeling of occupant behavior in numerical simulation.},

	abstract = {Rationale: The Severe Asthma Research Program cohort includes subjects with persistent asthma who have undergone detailed phenotypic characterization. Previous univariate methods compared features of mild, moderate, and severe asthma.Objectives: To identify novel asthma phenotypes using an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis.Methods: Reduction of the initial 628 variables to 34 core variables was achieved by elimination of redundant data and transformation of categorical variables into ranked ordinal composite variables. Cluster analysis was performed on 726 subjects.Measurements and Main Results: Five groups were identified. Subjects in Cluster 1 (n = 110) have early onset atopic asthma with normal lung function treated with two or fewer controller medications (82\%) and minimal health care utilization. Cluster 2 (n = 321) consists of subjects with early-onset atopic asthma and preserved lung function but increased medication requirements (29\% on three or more medications) and health care utilization. Cluster 3 (n = 59) is a unique group of mostly older obese women with late-onset nonatopic asthma, moderate reductions in FEV1, and frequent oral corticosteroid use to manage exacerbations. Subjects in Clusters 4 (n = 120) and 5 (n = 116) have severe airflow obstruction with bronchodilator responsiveness but differ in to their ability to attain normal lung function, age of asthma onset, atopic status, and use of oral corticosteroids.Conclusions: Five distinct clinical phenotypes of asthma have been identified using unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. All clusters contain subjects who meet the American Thoracic Society definition of severe asthma, which supports clinical heterogeneity in asthma and the need for new approaches for the classification of disease severity in asthma.},

As such, it is important to understand and differentiate the potential sub-groups among insomnia patients as well as individuals at risk for insomnia. Questionnaires completed by 291 students of both sexes and at risk for insomnia (FIRST scale score ≥ 22) were analyzed (age range 17–24 years). Two-step cluster analyses comprising all the valid cases (N = 291) were performed to analyze the phenotypes of individuals vulnerable to insomnia separately for men and women. The results showed that men and women present different psychological profiles. Among men, it was possible to distinguish two clusters: one with relatively low scores in negative psychological variables and high positive affect and another with high scores in negative psychological variables and low scores in positive affect. Among women, three clusters were observed: two resembling the ones found for the male sample and one additional cluster encompassing individuals with moderate scores on all of the measures. However, it is possible that this additional group in women may be due to the larger sample size. The current study supports the idea that among individuals at risk for insomnia, one can discriminate different profiles. Sex-related differences should be further investigated in the future.},

	abstract = {Space heating with gas as the primary fuel is a dominant contributor of residential energy consumption in UK and hence important for achieving UK's 2050 carbon targets. Whilst most cities in the UK have reduced their emissions per capita, there is a large variation of domestic gas consumption within cities. Past research suggests that the variations in gas consumption are as much as function of the quality of built environment, as it is of wider socio-economic-demographic features of households. Their combined influence on variations of residential heating consumption is however not well understood. This paper proposes a novel two-layer clustering framework to address this gap. The proposed framework constitutes of Gaussian Mixture Models and Hierarchical clustering and is illustrated through the analysis of residential gas consumption across London. Results show eight clusters of London Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) explained along 18 dimensions that include built-environment, social-economic and demographic information. These 8 clusters are used as variables to further cluster four groups of local authorities. The distinct gas consumption related properties of the resulting clusters explain the sources of variations in gas consumption across clusters and indicate possible directions for future fine-tuning of local policies.},

This article reviews the prevailing data-driven approaches used in building energy analysis under different archetypes and granularities, including those methods for prediction (artificial neural networks, support vector machines, statistical regression, decision tree and genetic algorithm) and those methods for classification (K-mean clustering, self-organizing map and hierarchy clustering). The review results demonstrate that the data-driven approaches have well addressed a large variety of building energy related applications, such as load forecasting and prediction, energy pattern profiling, regional energy-consumption mapping, benchmarking for building stocks, global retrofit strategies and guideline making etc. Significantly, this review refines a few key tasks for modification of the data-driven approaches in the context of application to building energy analysis. The conclusions drawn in this review could facilitate future micro-scale changes of energy use for a particular building through the appropriate retrofit and the inclusion of renewable energy technologies. It also paves an avenue to explore potential in macro-scale energy-reduction with consideration of customer demands. All these will be useful to establish a better long-term strategy for urban sustainability.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the development of a methodology for identifying and improving occupant behavior in existing residential buildings. In this study, end-use loads were divided into two levels (i.e. main and sub-category), and they were used to deduce corresponding two-level user activities (i.e. general and specific occupant behavior) indirectly. The proposed method is based on three basic data mining techniques: cluster analysis, classification analysis, and association rules mining. Cluster analysis and classification analysis are combined to analyze the main end-use loads, so as to identify energy-inefficient general occupant behavior. Then, association rules are mined to examine end-use loads at both levels, so as to identify energy-inefficient specific occupant behavior. In order to demonstrate its applicability, this methodology was applied to a group of residential buildings in Japan, and one building with the most comprehensive household appliances was selected as the case building. The results show that, for the case building, the method was able to identify the behavior which needs to be modified, and provide occupants with feasible recommendations so that they can make required decisions. Also, a reference building can be identified for the case building to evaluate its energy-saving potential due to occupant behavior modification. The results obtained could help building occupants to modify their behavior, thereby significantly reducing building energy consumption. Moreover, given that the proposed method is partly based on the comparison with similar buildings, it could motivate building occupants to modify their behavior.},

	abstract = {The availability of increasing amounts of data to electricity utilities through the implementation of domestic smart metering campaigns has meant that traditional ways of analysing meter reading information such as descriptive statistics has become increasingly difficult. Key characteristic information to the data is often lost, particularly when averaging or aggregation processes are applied. Therefore, other methods of analysing data need to be used so that this information is not lost. One such method which lends itself to analysing large amounts of information is data mining. This allows for the data to be segmented before such aggregation processes are applied. Moreover, segmentation allows for dimension reduction thus enabling easier manipulation of the data. Clustering methods have been used in the electricity industry for some time. However, their use at a domestic level has been somewhat limited to date. This paper investigates three of the most widely used unsupervised clustering methods: k-means, k-medoid and Self Organising Maps (SOM). The best performing technique is then evaluated in order to segment individual households into clusters based on their pattern of electricity use across the day. The process is repeated for each day over a six month period in order to characterise the diurnal, intra-daily and seasonal variations of domestic electricity demand. Based on these results a series of Profile Classes (PC’s) are presented that represent common patterns of electricity use within the home. Finally, each PC is linked to household characteristics by applying a multi-nominal logistic regression to the data. As a result, households and the manner with which they use electricity in the home can be characterised based on individual customer attributes.},

Using measured electricity use data from 103 homes in Austin, TX, this analysis sought to (1) determine the shape of seasonally-resolved residential demand profiles, (2) determine the optimal number of normalized representative residential electricity use profiles within each season, and (3) draw correlations to the different profiles based on survey data from the occupants of the 103 homes. Within each season, homes with similar hourly electricity use patterns were clustered into groups using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then probit regression was performed to determine if homeowner survey responses could serve as predictors for the clustering results. This analysis found that Austin homes fall into one of two seasonal groups with some homes using more expensive electricity (from a wholesale electricity market perspective) than others. Regression results indicate that variables such as if someone works from home, hours of television watched per week, and education levels have significant correlations with average profile shape, but might vary across seasons. The results herein also indicate that policies such as time-of-use or real-time electricity structures might be more likely to affect lower income households during some high electricity use parts of the year.},

These methods are making energy demand adaptive to fluctuations inherent to intermittent renewable energy sources. In order to develop feasible demand-side management solutions, a better understanding of the temporality of the energy demand is needed. This paper contributes to this by focusing on the daily load profiles of energy demand for heating of Danish dwellings with heat pumps. Based on hourly recordings from 139 dwellings and employing cluster and regression analysis, the paper explores patterns (typologies) in daily heating load profiles and how these relate to socio-economic and technical characteristics of the included households. The study shows that the load profiles vary according to the external load conditions. Two main clusters were identified for both weekdays and weekends and across load segments; a main cluster with a relatively constant load profile and a minor cluster with a more distinct variation during the day. The difference between the clusters is primarily correlated with building characteristics like floor area, building year and type of space heating distribution system, while the existence of children and teenagers in the household were the only significant socio-economic variables.},

	abstract = {Global warming and climate change have become a serious environmental problem and China's carbon emissions are currently the highest in the world. Cities are the main sources of carbon emissions and the key to solving these problems. Therefore, research on reducing carbon dioxide emissions is a matter of concern. In this study, a spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed to understand the spatial characteristics of carbon dioxide emissions in 171 Chinese cities. Then, stepwise and geographically weighted regressions were used to explore the processes that drive carbon dioxide emissions in Chinese cities. A two-step cluster was used to classify Chinese cities into different categories based on the degree of impact of each driver. The results showed that there is a spatial aggregation relationship between urban carbon dioxide emissions. High-high clusters mainly occur in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations, while low-low clusters occur in the central, western, and southwestern cities. Among all variables, freight volume, per capita gross domestic product, population density, and the proportion of secondary industries correlate positively with carbon dioxide emissions, whereas the number of buses per 10,000 people correlates negatively with carbon dioxide emissions. The geographically weighted regression model provided more detailed results and revealed the spatial heterogeneity of the effects of the different drivers. The impact of population, economic factors, and industrial factors in the eastern region is significantly greater than that in the central and western regions. Freight volume and public transport have the most significant impact in the northeast region. The clustering results showed that cities can be divided into four types. These findings provide a reference and policy suggestions for how cities in different regions should reduce carbon dioxide emissions.},

However such a broad topic inevitably results in number of alternative interpretations of the problem domain and the modelling tools used in its study. This paper seeks to pull together these strands by proposing a theoretical definition of an urban energy system model and then evaluating the state of current practice. Drawing on a review of 219 papers, five key areas of practice were identified – technology design, building design, urban climate, systems design, and policy assessment – each with distinct and incomplete interpretations of the problem domain. We also highlight a sixth field, land use and transportation modelling, which has direct relevance to the use of energy in cities but has been somewhat overlooked by the literature to date. Despite their diversity, these approaches to urban energy system modelling share four common challenges in understanding model complexity, data quality and uncertainty, model integration, and policy relevance. We then examine the opportunities for improving current practice in urban energy systems modelling, focusing on the potential of sensitivity analysis and cloud computing, data collection and integration techniques, and the use of activity-based modelling as an integrating framework. The results indicate that there is significant potential for urban energy systems modelling to move beyond single disciplinary approaches towards a sophisticated integrated perspective that more fully captures the theoretical intricacy of urban energy systems.},

Buildings play an important role in urban energy systems regarding both the demand and supply of energy. It is no longer sufficient to simulate building energy use assuming isolation from the microclimate and energy system in which they operate, or to model an urban energy system without consideration of the buildings that it serves. This review complements previous studies by focussing on models that address district-level interactions in energy systems, and by assessing the capabilities of the software tools available alongside the theory of the modelling approaches used. New models and tools that address these district-level interactions are reviewed and their competences assessed. These are divided into the following sections: district energy systems (including heat networks, multi-energy systems and low-temperature networks), renewable energy generation (including solar, bioenergy, wind and the related topic of seasonal storage), and the urban microclimate as it relates to energy demands. The scope and detail covered by twenty cross-disciplinary tools is summarised in a matrix; many other tools that focus on specific areas are also discussed. We end by summarising the current state of district-scale urban energy modelling as it relates to the built environment, along with our perspective on future challenges and research directions.},

Providing an analytical overview of some previous efforts, the present contribution introduces a novel two-step approach toward bottom-up urban energy computing, involving a reductive phase and a re-diversification process. The reductive phase is performed through an automated process within a GIS platform. The developed process utilizes available large-scale data to generated an energy-relevant representation of the urban building stock. A matrix of energy-influential building characteristics, depicted as aggregate descriptive indicators, is computed based on the generated representation and subjected to multivariate cluster analysis methods for stock classification. The resulting classes are represented through typical buildings, which undergo detailed performance simulation computations. The re-diversification process addresses the loss of diversity due to the reductive method, through employment of stochastic occupancy models and model parametrization. This paper reports on the development of the reductive step, illustrating the encountered challenges and the adopted responses.},

	abstract = {Thematic analysis is frequently used to analyse qualitative data in psychology, healthcare, social research and beyond. An important stage in planning a study is determining how large a sample size may be required, however current guidelines for thematic analysis are varied, ranging from around 2 to over 400 and it is unclear how to choose a value from the space in between. Some guidance can also not be applied prospectively. This paper introduces a tool to help users think about what would be a useful sample size for their particular context when investigating patterns across participants. The calculation depends on (a) the expected population theme prevalence of the least prevalent theme, derived either from prior knowledge or based on the prevalence of the rarest themes considered worth uncovering, e.g. 1 in 10, 1 in 100; (b) the number of desired instances of the theme; and (c) the power of the study. An adequately powered study will have a high likelihood of finding sufficient themes of the desired prevalence. This calculation can then be used alongside other considerations. We illustrate how to use the method to calculate sample size before starting a study and achieved power given a sample size, providing tables of answers and code for use in the free software, R. Sample sizes are comparable to those found in the literature, for example to have 80\% power to detect two instances of a theme with 10\% prevalence, 29 participants are required. Increasing power, increasing the number of instances or decreasing prevalence increases the sample size needed. We do not propose this as a ritualistic requirement for study design, but rather as a pragmatic supporting tool to help plan studies using thematic analysis.},

It has also been generalized in various ways. Two algorithms are found in the literature and software, both announcing that they implement the Ward clustering method. When applied to the same distance matrix, they produce different results. One algorithm preserves Ward’s criterion, the other does not. Our survey work and case studies will be useful for all those involved in developing software for data analysis using Ward’s hierarchical clustering method.},

Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n − 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n − 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained.

The mechanics of the method are outlined in 8 concrete steps. Although verbal analyses can be used for many purposes, the main goal of the analyses discussed here is to formulate an understanding of the representation of the knowledge used in cognitive performances and how that representation changes with learning. This can be contrasted with another method of analyzing verbal protocols, the goal of which is to validate the cognitive processes of human performance, often as embodied in a computational model.},

The Framework Method is becoming an increasingly popular approach to the management and analysis of qualitative data in health research. However, there is confusion about its potential application and limitations.

Discussion
The article discusses when it is appropriate to adopt the Framework Method and explains the procedure for using it in multi-disciplinary health research teams, or those that involve clinicians, patients and lay people. The stages of the method are illustrated using examples from a published study.

Summary
Used effectively, with the leadership of an experienced qualitative researcher, the Framework Method is a systematic and flexible approach to analysing qualitative data and is appropriate for use in research teams even where not all members have previous experience of conducting qualitative research.},

In other words, they are being used interchangeably and it seems difficult for the researcher to choose between them. In this respect, this paper describes and discusses the boundaries between qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis and presents implications to improve the consistency between the purpose of related studies and the method of data analyses. This is a discussion paper, comprising an analytical overview and discussion of the definitions, aims, philosophical background, data gathering, and analysis of content analysis and thematic analysis, and addressing their methodological subtleties. It is concluded that in spite of many similarities between the approaches, including cutting across data and searching for patterns and themes, their main difference lies in the opportunity for quantification of data. It means that measuring the frequency of different categories and themes is possible in content analysis with caution as a proxy for significance.},

To be accepted as trustworthy, qualitative researchers must demonstrate that data analysis has been conducted in a precise, consistent, and exhaustive manner through recording, systematizing, and disclosing the methods of analysis with enough detail to enable the reader to determine whether the process is credible. Although there are numerous examples of how to conduct qualitative research, few sophisticated tools are available to researchers for conducting a rigorous and relevant thematic analysis. The purpose of this article is to guide researchers using thematic analysis as a research method. We offer personal insights and practical examples, while exploring issues of rigor and trustworthiness. The process of conducting a thematic analysis is illustrated through the presentation of an auditable decision trail, guiding interpreting and representing textual data. We detail our step-by-step approach to exploring the effectiveness of strategic clinical networks in Alberta, Canada, in our mixed methods case study.

	abstract = {Background: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a userfriendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
Results: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings.
Conclusion: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/ horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

In this paper, the author considers six cases of urban street networks characterized by different patterns and historical roots. The authors propose a representation of the street networks based firstly on a primal graph, where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. In a second step, a dual graph, where streets are nodes and intersections are edges, is constructed by means of a generalization model named Intersection Continuity Negotiation, which allows to acknowledge the continuity of streets over a plurality of edges. Finally, the authors address a comparative study of some structural properties of the dual graphs, seeking significant similarities among clusters of cases. A wide set of network analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the authors show that the absence of any clue of assortativity differentiates urban street networks from other non-geographic systems and that most of the considered networks have a broad degree distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties as well.},

In this paper we introduce a new community-detection framework called LambdaCC that is based on a specially weighted version of correlation clustering. A key component in our methodology is a clustering resolution parameter, λ, which implicitly controls the size and structure of clusters formed by our framework. We show that, by increasing this parameter, our objective effectively interpolates between two different strategies in graph clustering: finding a sparse cut and forming dense subgraphs. Our methodology unifies and generalizes a number of other important clustering quality functions including modularity, sparsest cut, and cluster deletion, and places them all within the context of an optimization problem that has been well studied from the perspective of approximation algorithms. Our approach is particularly relevant in the regime of finding dense clusters, as it leads to a 2-approximation for the cluster deletion problem. We use our approach to cluster several graphs, including large collaboration networks and social networks.},

It reconciles, in a sense, two different approaches to the investigation of the spatial relationships between the points, viz., the agglomerative and the divisive methods. A graph, the shortest dendrite of Florek etal. (1951a), is constructed on a nearest neighbour basis and then divided into clusters by applying the criterion of minimum within cluster sum of squares. This procedure ensures an effective reduction of the number of possible splits. The method may be applied to a dichotomous division, but is perfectly suitable also for a global division into any number of clusters. An informal indicator of the "best number" of clusters is suggested. It is a"variance ratio criterion" giving some insight into the structure of the points. The method is illustrated by three examples, one of which is original. The results obtained by the dendrite method are compared with those obtained by using the agglomerative method or Ward (1963) and the divisive method of Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1965).},

Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m∼n and d∼logn, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(nlog2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2×106 edges.

This formulation is motivated from a document clustering problem in which one has a pairwise similarity function f learned from past data, and the goal is to partition the current set of documents in a way that correlates with f as much as possible; it can also be viewed as a kind of “agnostic learning” problem.},

	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/1959.9/561679},
	abstract = {Due to the monopolistic nature of the tap water services, limited marketing scholarship exists to account for the specific characteristics of water utilities. Service-Dominant Logic is an influential paradigm in marketing, but there is little research on its applicability to managerial practice, especially concerning the marketing of products, such as tap water. This dissertation develops a framework for water utility marketing based on the Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic) paradigm. These objectives are achieved through an anthology of four thematically related studies about water utility marketing guided by the axioms of S-D Logic. The first two studies explore the activities of water utilities from a macromarketing and services marketing perspective, corroborated by interviews with customer advocacy organisations and regulators, and a content analysis of industry literature. The third study analyses employee attitudes towards customer-centric service provision. The last study introduces the concept of Service-Dominant Quality, a Service Quality model based on the axioms of S-D Logic. The findings of these studies are synthesised to review the applicability of S-D Logic to marketing practice. The exploratory research defines a Marketing Mix for tap water services. Analysis of employee data provides insight into the relationships between engineers and marketers in water utilities. The SERVAQUA survey instrument was developed to measure Service Quality for tap water, based on S-D Logic. Synthesising these findings enhances understanding of how Service-Dominant Logic can be applied to a managerial context. The main contribution to theory is advancing S-D Logic as an informal system of logic to expand the paradigm into practice. The S-D Logic framework is modified to provide a better fit to the particular characteristics of marketing products. Main contributions to practice are a framework to implement marketing in water utilities, including an industry-specific Marketing Mix and Service Quality survey instrument.},

In The Discovery of Grounded Theory, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss address the equally Important enterprise of how the discovery of theory from data systematically obtained and analyzed in social research--can be furthered. The discovery of theory from data--grounded theory-- is a major task confronting sociology, for such a theory fits empirical situations, and is understandable to sociologists and laymen alike. Most important, it provides relevant predictions, explanations, interpretations, and applications. In Part I of the book, "Generation Theory by Comparative Analysis," the authors present a strategy whereby sociologists can facilitate the discovery of grounded theory, both substantive and formal. This strategy involves the systematic choice and study of several comparison groups. In Part II, The Flexible Use of Data," the generation of theory from qualitative, especially documentary, and quantitative data Is considered. In Part III, "Implications of Grounded Theory," Glaser and Strauss examine the credibility of grounded theory. The Discovery of Grounded Theory is directed toward improving social scientists' capacity for generating theory that will be relevant to their research. While aimed primarily at sociologists, it will be useful to anyone Interested In studying social phenomena political, educational, economic, industrial especially If their studies are based on qualitative data."--Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {Research in building energy consumption often uses semi-structured interviews to produce qualitative data on consumer beliefs, attitudes, practices and skills. A survey of 54 recent papers in six prominent building and energy journals shows that the samples are typically small, but inferences are often made for interventions in the light of the findings, on the assumption that these are somehow transferable to wider populations. It is often asked ‘how many interviews are enough’ to produce reliable results. Theoretical literature on this theme has avoided a straightforward statistical critique, and justified the practice with appeals to precedent, the special nature of qualitative personal data, and a limited pool of empirical work. This paper reviews this literature and presents a statistical approach, based on binomial logic, to critiquing and supporting the practice of semi-structured interview research in the building and energy field. The approach developed offers a set of straightforward criteria which researchers can use to estimate the reliability of their findings and inferences from the qualitative data produced in semi-structured interviews.},

	abstract = {Solid fuel combustion is a major cause of household air pollution, a leading environmental health risk factor globally. In India, over 750 million people continue to rely on firewood and other solid fuels for daily cooking. We explore the drivers of adoption and use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), India’s dominant clean cooking fuel. We document strides in LPG ownership using a panel dataset of over 8,500 rural households from six Indian states surveyed in 2015 and 2018 (ACCESS), partially due to India’s flagship clean cooking policy Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). We further demonstrate that the drivers of initial LPG adoption also apply to use. While fuel stacking—using solid fuels and LPG jointly—is pervasive, improved rural incomes and education result in the increased use of clean cooking fuels. After adoption, general LPG customers are predicted to consume on average 93 kilograms of LPG yearly (95\% confidence interval (CI): 91–95 kg/year). However, PMUY beneficiaries are predicted to consume 27 kilograms of LPG (95\% CI: 24–30 kg/year) less on average than general customers each year, even after controlling for socio-economic differences and years of using LPG. Our findings suggest that additional strategies to accelerate the transition to exclusive LPG use among the 80 million households acquiring LPG through PMUY should aim to improve affordability and increase awareness to realize the full benefits of the Government of India’s investments in cleaner cooking.},

However, there are likely to be unobserved influences on risk, typically spatially clustered, which can be modeled as random effects. Regression impacts may be biased if no account is taken of spatially structured influences on risk. Furthermore a default assumption of linear effects of area variables may also misstate or understate their impact. This paper considers variations in suicide outcomes for small areas across England, and investigates the impact on them of area socio-economic variables, while also investigating potential nonlinearity in their impact and allowing for spatially clustered unobserved factors. The outcomes are self-harm hospitalisations and suicide mortality over 6,781 Middle Level Super Output Areas.},

In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor.

It shows that the scheme offered more than 80 million LPG connections and contributed to a sharp replacement of traditional fuel (firewood, kerosene, dung cake, etc.) between the years 2014 and 2018. However, a large share of these new consumers appears to have stopped LPG consumption soon after the distribution under the scheme. This is clearly evident in the huge number of inactive LPG connections which continue to increase—from 35.8 million inactive connections in the country in 2017 to 43.2 million in 2019. Though PMUY contributed to the increase in LPG connections, it failed to accelerate its consumption demand among the beneficiaries. Nearly ₹128 billion has been spent by the government in form of subsidies and around 70\% of the PMUY beneficiaries have availed loans from Oil Manufacturing Companies (OMCs). If the LPG consumption fails to accelerate, these one-time subsidies provided by the government will fail to achieve the objective and the loans disbursed by the OMCs may turn into non-performing assets.},

This raises the questions of competition among different options, commercial viability of the mini-grids, or a duplication of highly subsidized resources. A survey of 477 households in off-grid areas of Bangladesh was conducted to find out factors affecting the households’ choice of domestic electricity. The study utilizes a multinomial logit model to investigate how household demographic, educational, income, wealth and infrastructure factors affect electricity choice in off-grid areas, and a Heckman two stage model to explore how these factors affect energy stacking. Finally, a Tobit model and a Heckman model are used to find out how household characteristics affect the expenditure on electricity from solar mini-grids (SMG). It was found that the level of female education in the family leads to the choice of higher tier clean electricity services, whereas male education influences the total expenditure on electricity. Property ownership predicts choice of higher tier electricity access. Households with more income and higher education of males stack solar home systems with mini-grid connection. Stacking households actually spend more on mini-grid electricity. The findings of the study has implications on energy policy and investment for off-grid rural electrification and energy poverty alleviation.},

Literature highlights the high correlation between human development and unequal access to energy.1 The term “fuel poverty” is of importance here especially in a developing country context like India where access to clean fuel is a far sight for many despite key governmental initiatives promoting and subsidising access to clean fuel. The present article examines the impact of poverty on the likelihood of a household to shift to clean fuel for cooking, heating, etc. The present article shows that the usual method of estimating poverty is not sufficient enough to explain behavioural change among rural households. In fact, the simple provision of subsidy cannot ensure the complete shift of households to clean cooking fuel option. For this, a multidimensional poverty index concept is more appropriate. The article shows that multidimensional poverty act as a binding constraint in the shift of household from polluting cooking fuel to clean fuel option.},

It primarily investigates cooking energy end-use within female-headed households (FHHs) residing in the town and specifically focuses on women who disproportionately suffer the impacts of energy accessibility. This study reveals that commercial cooking fuels are increasingly scarce and expensive, and the costs of modern cooking appliances are beyond the purchasing ability of most urban FHHs. Meeting the energy requirements in sustainable manner, thus, continues to be a major challenge that hinders FHHs’ efforts to improve their living situations. The results further show that though the income is an important factor, it is not the only powerful determinant in the consumption of cooking fuels within FHHs. Other socioeconomic characteristics were found to have a significant impact too. This study further examines the relevance of the “fuel stacking” model and finds that the majority of the FHHs, regardless of their economic status, depend on wood fuels as their primary cooking energy source. Even when family incomes rose, complete transition to cleaner fuels has not taken place; instead, it added fuels in the fuel stacking process.},

	abstract = {The spatial variability of gas consumption is investigated in non-domestic buildings across districts of Greater London, UK. It is argued that the energy consumption of a building is to some extent influenced by where the building is located in a city, due to contextual features of its own district as well as those of neighbouring districts. Using Bayesian spatial models, the analysis suggests the energy consumption due to the influence of district features can be quantified and dissociated from the energy consumption associated with the physical features and operational characteristics of the buildings. An important distinction is made between extrinsic values of energy consumption (district features) and intrinsic values (building characteristics, management and operation). The results indicate that 90\% of the mean value of extrinsic gas consumption across districts in London is between –42 and 87 kWh/m2. Buildings located in districts that have positive values of extrinsic gas consumption consume more gas over and above their expected intrinsic value of gas consumption. The novel features of this study are in the quantification and propagation of district-scale features to their influence on buildings, and the reduction in uncertainties around the mean value of gas consumed by different building types.},

Here we characterize synergies and trade-offs between efforts to achieve SDG7 and delivery of the 2030 Agenda as a whole. We identify 113 targets requiring actions to change energy systems, and published evidence of relationships between 143 targets (143 synergies, 65 trade-offs) and efforts to achieve SDG7. Synergies and trade-offs exist in three key domains, where decisions about SDG7 affect humanity’s ability to: realize aspirations of greater welfare and well-being; build physical and social infrastructures for sustainable development; and achieve sustainable management of the natural environment. There is an urgent need to better organize, connect and extend this evidence, to help all actors work together to achieve sustainable development.},

Here, we propose a research agenda focused on three key issues: understanding the needs of urban energy users; enabling the use of context-specific, disaggregated data; and engaging with effective modes of energy and urban governance.

By bringing together author-teams of practitioners, academics, businesses, and policy makers, this collection encourages interdisciplinary dialogue about the best way of approaching energy provision for the forcibly displaced.

To increase energy access, it is vital to understand the PAYG SHS customer journey in depth. To aid this, the paper presents unique data from active customers, consisting of structured interviews (n = 100) and two focus groups (n = 24) across two districts in Rwanda. These results are presented under a novel customer journey framework, which describes all the individual stages a customer might experience, including awareness and understanding, purchase, usage, upgrade, recommendation and retaining or switching energy source. The paper reveals that the customer journey is non-linear and cyclical in nature, acknowledging that a household operates in a social network within which they could influence or be influenced by others. It also highlights the growing importance of SHS recommendations in raising awareness of SHSs, pointing to the shifts in the off-grid energy market environment where customer awareness no longer appears to be a main adoption barrier.},

Previous research highlights the relevance of simulation techniques in estimating the potential outcomes of changes in areas such as taxation and child benefit policy, crime, education, or health inequalities. To date, however, there is very little published research on the creation, calibration, and testing of such micro-populations and models, and little on the issue of how well synthetic data can fit locally as opposed to globally in such models. This paper discusses the process of improving the process of synthetic micropopulation generation with the aim of improving and extending existing spatial microsimulation models. Experiments using different variable configurations to constrain the models are undertaken with the emphasis on producing a suite of models to match the different sociodemographic conditions found within a typical city. The results show that creating processes to generate area-specific synthetic populations, which reflect the diverse populations within the study area, provides more accurate population estimates for future policy work than the traditional global model configurations.},

This paper describes the development and application of a global model for rural electrification. The model is used to assess future trends in electrification, and the associated investment needs. The model is applied for a set of electrification scenarios. We find that the trend in increasing electrification differs considerably among world regions: in Latin America and Asia access to electricity takes place at lower income levels than in Africa. Under business-as-usual developments, universal access to electricity is not reached by 2030 in Latin America, Asia or sub-Saharan Africa. Investments per household depend strongly on population density, implying relatively low costs in most Asian subregions. Global cumulative investments to reach universal access to electricity by 2030 amount 477–868 billion USD2005, which would be 238–400 billion additional to business-as-usual (or 12–20 billion USD2005 per year). The potential for mini-grid and off-grid technologies is expected to be high in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, and lower in Asia. This is a result of high costs of grid electrification at low population densities in large parts of rural Africa and Latin America.},

This model simulates energy use on the basis of changes in useful energy intensity, technology development (AEEI) and price responses (PIEEI). We find that different implementations of these factors yield behavioural model results. Model calibration uncertainty is identified as influential source for variation in future projections: amounting 30\% to 100\% around the best estimate. Energy modellers should systematically account for this and communicate calibration uncertainty ranges.},

	abstract = {For almost half a century, Paul Meehl educated psychologists about how the mindless use of null-hypothesis significance tests made research on theories in the social sciences basically uninterpretable. In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalizing procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and influential. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychological scientists have begun to realize that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound ?derivation chain? between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various nonconfirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognized and incentivized as a crucial goal in itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to nonconfirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology?s reform movement and help us to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged.},

efficient, easily outperforming common IPF implementations. It is freely available as an open source R package called humanleague. Finally, we suggest how the current limitations of the implementation can be
overcome, providing a direction for future work.},

	abstract = {Increasingly complex models are being used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of medical interventions. We describe the multiple sources of uncertainty that are relevant to such models, and their relation to either probabilistic or deterministic sensitivity analysis. A Bayesian approach appears natural in this context. We explore how sensitivity analysis to patient heterogeneity and parameter uncertainty can be simultaneously investigated, and illustrate the necessary computation when expected costs and benefits can be calculated in closed form, such as in discrete-time discrete-state Markov models. Information about parameters can either be expressed as a prior distribution, or derived as a posterior distribution given a generalized synthesis of available data in which multiple sources of evidence can be differentially weighted according to their assumed quality. The resulting joint posterior distributions on costs and benefits can then provide inferences on incremental cost-effectiveness, best presented as posterior distributions over net-benefit and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. These ideas are illustrated with a detailed running example concerning the cost-effectiveness of hip prostheses in different age–sex subgroups.

	abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

	abstract = {Iterative proportional fitting (IPF) is a widely used method for spatial microsimulation. The technique results in non-integer weights for individual rows of data. This is problematic for certain applications and has led many researchers to favour combinatorial optimisation approaches such as simulated annealing. An alternative to this is ‘integerisation’ of IPF weights: the translation of the continuous weight variable into a discrete number of unique or ‘cloned’ individuals. We describe four existing methods of integerisation and present a new one. Our method – ‘truncate, replicate, sample’ (TRS) – recognises that IPF weights consist of both ‘replication weights’ and ‘conventional weights’, the effects of which need to be separated. The procedure consists of three steps: (1) separate replication and conventional weights by truncation; (2) replication of individuals with positive integer weights; and (3) probabilistic sampling. The results, which are reproducible using supplementary code and data published alongside this paper, show that TRS is fast, and more accurate than alternative approaches to integerisation.},

This paper builds on traditional economic microsimulation frameworks by adding a geographical dimension. More specifically, we seek to model national social policy impacts at a microspatial scale. First, spatial microsimulation modelling is used to synthesise a household micropopulation geographical database for an entire city. This micropopulation database has a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic attributes that are relevant to national social and economic policies and which play a major role in the determination of eligibility of households for various benefits and allowances. GIS software is used to identify the size and spatial location of particular groups such as the unskilled, low-waged, and undereducated. Finally, we explore potential social policies and demonstrate how microsimulation modelling can be used to perform what-if social policy analysis at the small-area level.},

The present paper argues the contrary, since many problems in the analysis of spatial data can be interpreted as problems of image restoration. Furthermore, the amounts of data involved allow routine use of computer intensive methods, such as the Gibbs sampler, that are not yet practicable for conventional images. Two examples are given, one in archeology, the other in epidemiology. These are preceded by a partial review of pixel-based Bayesian image analysis.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by ﬁrst-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC’s performance is highly sensitive to two user-speciﬁed parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as eﬃciently as (and sometimes more eﬃciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the ﬂy based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require eﬃcient “turnkey” samplers.},

This study uses data science approaches to integrate quantitative and qualitative data from a survey of low-income households in Bangalore, to identify dominant socio-economic characteristics, behaviours, and decision-making that act as barriers to clean cooking across a community. Key barriers identified include awareness and access to subsidy programmes, safety concerns, as well as weak community networks.

	abstract = {Background
Household air pollution (HAP) from combustion of solid fuels is an important contributor to disease burden in low- and middle-income countries (LIC, and MIC). However, current HAP cardiovascular disease burden estimates are based on integrated exposure response curves that are not currently informed by quantitative HAP studies in LIC and MIC. While there is adequate evidence supporting causal relationships between HAP and respiratory disease, large cohort studies specifically examining relationships between quantitative measures of HAP exposure with cardiovascular disease are lacking.

Objective
We aim to improve upon exposure proxies based on fuel type, and to reduce exposure misclassification by quantitatively measuring exposure across varying cooking fuel types and conditions in diverse geographies and socioeconomic settings. We leverage technology advancements to estimate household and personal PM2.5 (particles below 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter) exposure within the large (N{\textasciitilde}250,000) multi-country (N{\textasciitilde}26) Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological [PURE] cohort study. Here, we detail the study protocol and the innovative methodologies being used to characterize HAP exposures, and their application in epidemiologic analyses.

Methods/Design
This study characterizes HAP PM2.5 exposures for participants in rural communities in ten PURE countries with {\textgreater}10\% solid fuel use at baseline (Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe). PM2.5 monitoring includes 48-hour cooking area measurements in 4,500 households and simultaneous personal monitoring of male and female pairs from 20\% of the selected households. Repeat measurements occur in 20\% of households to assess impacts of seasonality. Monitoring began in 2017, and will continue through 2019. The Ultrasonic Personal Aerosol Sampler (UPAS), a novel, robust, and inexpensive filter based monitor that is programmable through a dedicated mobile phone application is used for sampling. Pilot study field evaluation of cooking area measurements indicated high correlation between the UPAS and reference Harvard Impactors (r = 0.91; 95\% CI: 0.84, 0.95; slope=0.95). To facilitate tracking and to minimize contamination and analytical error, the samplers utilize barcoded filters and filter cartridges that are weighed pre- and post-sampling using a fully automated weighing system. Pump flow and pressure measurements, temperature and RH, GPS coordinates and semi-quantitative continuous particle mass concentrations based on filter differential pressure are uploaded to a central server automatically whenever the mobile phone is connected to the internet, with sampled data automatically screened for quality control parameters. A short survey is administered during the 48-hr monitoring period. Post-weighed filters are further analyzed to estimate black carbon concentrations through a semi-automated, rapid, cost-effective image analysis approach. The measured PM2.5 data will then be combined with PURE survey information on household characteristics and behaviours collected at baseline and during follow-up to develop quantitative HAP models for PM2.5 exposures for all rural PURE participants ({\textasciitilde}50,000) and across different cooking fuel types within the 10 index countries. Both the measured (in the subset) and the modelled exposures will be used in separate longitudinal epidemiologic analyses to assess associations with cardiopulmonary mortality, and disease incidence.

Discussion
The collected data and resulting characterization of cooking area and personal PM2.5 exposures in multiple rural communities from 10 countries will better inform exposure assessment as well as future epidemiologic analyses assessing the relationships between quantitative estimates of chronic HAP exposure with adult mortality and incident cardiovascular and respiratory disease. This will provide refined and more accurate exposure estimates in global CVD related exposure-response analyses.},

There are three principal findings: (i) fuel costs are a critical obstacle to widespread adoption, (ii) fuel stacking is the prevailing norm as few households stop using firewood when adopting LPG, and (iii) both users and non-users have highly positive views of LPG as a convenient and clean cooking fuel. These findings show that expanding LPG use offers great promise in rural India, but affordability prevents a complete transition from traditional biomass to clean cooking fuels.},

	abstract = {Solid biomass fuel use is closely intertwined with the life of rural households in Asia. However, its consumption and demand vary significantly across different countries, states and in various agro-climatic zones. Uses of solid biomass fuel in the kitchen not only leads to household air pollution but also influences the air quality in the regions of Indo- Gangetic plains. Considering this, current study assesses the household fuel use pattern and trend in India. Further, the socio-cultural, economical and behavioral factors which can influence the household fuel choice were evaluated through a case study from Punjab, India using a standard questionnaire. The decadal trend in household energy consumption pattern shows that 77.5\% of rural households in India rely on solid biomass fuel for cooking. Further, during the last 30 years (upto 2011), only 2\% of rural households shifted from solid biomass fuel to cleaner fuels. However, after 2011 data shows significant uptake of the cleaner fuels for the household cooking purposes. Results of the case study show that rural households depend on numerous approaches rather than relying on a particular source of household energy. This contradicts the energy ladder hypothesis of improvement in energy source with an increase in income. Cooking fuel preferences were found to be significantly determined by socio-economic and cultural factors. Thus, providing improved cookstoves or cleaner fuels are not sufficient to attain their sustained use. Hence, the current study highlights the need for effective user-behavior focused interventions to enhance the transition towards cleaner fuel for household energy.},

	abstract = {Most of the research around the world has been on outdoor air pollution, but in India we have a more severe problem of Indoor Air Pollution (IAP). The foremost factor cited for is burning of fossil fuels for cooking. Among the 70\% of the country's rural population, about 80\% households rely on biomass fuel making India to top the list of countries with largest population lacking access to cleaner fuel for cooking. 4 million deaths and 5\% disability-adjusted life-years is an upshot of exposure to IAP from unhealthy cooking making it globally the most critical environmental risk factor. India alone bears the highest burden (28\% needless deaths) among developing countries. Moreover, about ¼ of ambient PM2.5 in the country comes from household cookfuels. These considerations have prompted the discussion of the present knowledge on the disastrous health effects of pollutants emitted by biomass combustion in India. Additionally, Particulate Matter as an indoor air pollutant is highlighted with main focus on its spatial temporal variation and some recent Indian studies are further explored. As there are no specific norms for IAP in India, urgent need has arisen for implementing the strategies to create public awareness. Moreover improvement in ventilation and modification in the pattern of fuel will also contribute to eradicate this national health issue.},

	abstract = {BackgroundWith 40\% of the world’s population relying on solid fuel, household air pollution (HAP) represents a major preventable risk factor for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Meta-analyses have confirmed this relationship; however, constituent studies are observational, with virtually none measuring exposure directly.ObjectivesWe estimated associations between HAP exposure and respiratory symptoms and lung function in young, nonsmoking women in rural Guatemala, using measured carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in exhaled breath and personal air to assess exposure.MethodsThe Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects (RESPIRE) Guatemala study was a trial comparing respiratory outcomes among 504 women using improved chimney stoves versus traditional cookstoves. The present analysis included 456 women with data from postintervention surveys including interviews at 6, 12, and 18 months (respiratory symptoms) and spirometry and CO (ppm) in exhaled breath measurements. Personal CO was measured using passive diffusion tubes at variable times during the study. Associations between CO concentrations and respiratory health were estimated using random intercept regression models.Results:Respiratory symptoms (cough, phlegm, wheeze, or chest tightness) during the previous 6 months were positively associated with breath CO measured at the same time of symptom reporting and with average personal CO concentrations during the follow-up period. CO in exhaled breath at the same time as spirometry was associated with lower lung function [average reduction in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec) for a 10\% increase in CO was 3.33 mL (95\% CI: –0.86, –5.81)]. Lung function measures were not significantly associated with average postintervention personal CO concentrations.Conclusions:Our results provide further support for the effects of HAP exposures on airway inflammation. Further longitudinal research modeling continuous exposure to particulate matter against lung function will help us understand more fully the impact of HAP on COPD.Citation:Pope D, Diaz E, Smith-Sivertsen T, Lie RT, Bakke P, Balmes JR, Smith KR, Bruce NG. 2015.

This article describes how the HAP CRA was framed; how global HAP exposures were modeled; how diseases were judged to have sufficient evidence for inclusion; and how meta-analyses and exposure-response modeling were done to estimate relative risks. We explore relationships with the other air pollution risk factors: ambient air pollution, smoking, and secondhand smoke. We conclude with sensitivity analyses to illustrate some of the major uncertainties and recommendations for future work. We estimate that in 2010 HAP was responsible for 3.9 million premature deaths and ∼4.8\% of lost healthy life years (DALYs), ranking it highest among environmental risk factors examined and one of the major risk factors of any type globally.},

Application of consistent test practices allows emissions and energy efficiency performance to be benchmarked and enables meaningful comparisons among traditional and advanced stove types. In this study, 22 cookstoves burning six fuel types (wood, charcoal, pellets, corn cobs, rice hulls, and plant oil) at two fuel moisture levels were examined under laboratory-controlled operating conditions as outlined in the Water Boiling Test (WBT) protocol, Version 4. Pollutant emissions (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, total hydrocarbons, and ultrafine particles) were continuously monitored. Fine particle mass was measured gravimetrically for each WBT phase. Additional measurements included cookstove power, energy efficiency, and fuel use. Emission factors are given on the basis of fuel energy, cooking energy, fuel mass, time, and cooking task or activity. The lowest PM2.5 emissions were 74 mg MJdelivered–1 from a technologically advanced cookstove compared with 700–1400 mg MJdelivered–1 from the base-case open 3-stone cookfire. The highest thermal efficiency was 53\% compared with 14–15\% for the 3-stone cookfire. Based on these laboratory-controlled test results and observations, recommendations for developing potentially useful metrics for setting international standards are suggested.},

Highlighting the process of problematization, the linking of problems with actionable solutions, we show how US-based humanitarian advocacy organizations drew upon spatial, gender, perpetrator, racial, and interventionist representations to advance the notion that “stoves reduce rape” in Darfur. Though their effectiveness in Darfur remains questionable, efficient stoves were consequently adopted as a universal technical panacea for sexual violence in any conflict or refugee camp context. By examining the emergence and global diffusion of the rape-stove problematization, our study documents an important example of the technologizing of humanitarian space. We postulate fuel-efficient stoves to be a technology of Othering able to simplify, combine, decontextualize, and transform problematizations from their originating contexts elsewhere. When humanitarian advocates construe immensely complex crises as “manageable problems,” the promotion of simple technical panaceas may inadvertently increase the burden of poverty for user-beneficiaries and silence the voices of those they claim to champion and serve.},

We focus on two of its most striking characteristics: its macroeconomics; and its inextricable linkage of climate change mitigation and the reduction of economic inequality. We find Sanders’ GND economically credible and argue that the GND's use of Keynesian demand-side macroeconomics challenges governments, policymakers and citizens to think anew about the nature of money. We suggest social scientists need to challenge neoclassical economic assumptions, which, we argue, enable both climate destruction and inequality to continue. We find the GND's combining of climate protection and equality credible, and argue that shifting the debate away from neoclassical understandings of public debt to careful assessments of inflationary impacts and resource needs will generate more productive analysis.

By suppressing their antipathies to the political status quo, the East Europeans misled everyone, including themselves, as to the possibility of a successful uprising. In effect, they conferred on their privately despised governments an aura of invincibility. Under the circumstances, public opposition was poised to grow explosively if ever enough people lost their fear of exposing their private preferences. The currently popular theories of revolution do not make clear why uprisings easily explained in retrospect may not have been anticipated. The theory developed here fills this void.

	abstract = {In this article, I explore the politics of infrastructure in South Africa by focusing on the “travels” of a small technical device. Since the end of apartheid, prepaid meters have been widely deployed in South Africa's townships to curb the nonpayment of service charges. Yet many residents have bypassed their meters, enabling them to illicitly access electricity or water. I track the micro-political battle between residents tinkering with the technology and engineers trying to secure it, arguing that infrastructure itself becomes a political terrain for the negotiation of central ethical and political questions concerning civic virtue and the shape of citizenship. To investigate this techno-political terrain, I trace a genealogy of the meter from Victorian Britain, when it was invented as a tool of working-class “moral improvement,” to the late-apartheid period, when it was re-assembled as a device of counterinsurgency against the anti-apartheid “rent boycotts.” In each moment, I suggest, the meter was harnessed to distinct ethical regimes and political projects. Drawing on my ethnographic fieldwork with engineers in contemporary South Africa, I explore the semiotic-material work required to make the device functional in the post-apartheid moment. Tracing the travels of a small technical device across time and space, I argue, opens up conceptual space to rethink the relationship between ethics, politics, and technics.},

Many studies ask uninteresting research questions, make only marginal contributions, and lack innovative methods or application to theory. Many studies also have no explicit research design, lack rigor, or suffer from mangled structure and poor quality of writing. To help remedy these shortcomings, this Review offers suggestions for how to construct research questions; thoughtfully engage with concepts; state objectives; and appropriately select research methods. Then, the Review offers suggestions for enhancing theoretical, methodological, and empirical novelty. In terms of rigor, codes of practice are presented across seven method categories: experiments, literature reviews, data collection, data analysis, quantitative energy modeling, qualitative analysis, and case studies. We also recommend that researchers beware of hierarchies of evidence utilized in some disciplines, and that researchers place more emphasis on balance and appropriateness in research design. In terms of style, we offer tips regarding macro and microstructure and analysis, as well as coherent writing. Our hope is that this Review will inspire more interesting, robust, multi-method, comparative, interdisciplinary and impactful research that will accelerate the contribution that energy social science can make to both theory and practice.},

	abstract = {Energy scenarios, relying on wide-ranging assumptions about the future, do not always adequately reflect the lock-in risks caused by planned power-generation projects and the uncertainty around their chances of realization. In this study we built a machine-learning model that demonstrates high accuracy in predicting power-generation project failure and success using the largest dataset on historic and planned power plants available for Africa, combined with country-level characteristics. We found that the most relevant factors for successful commissioning of past projects are at plant level: capacity, fuel, ownership and connection type. We applied the trained model to predict the realization of the current project pipeline. Contrary to rapid transition scenarios, our results show that the share of non-hydro renewables in electricity generation is likely to remain below 10\% in 2030, despite total generation more than doubling. These findings point to high carbon lock-in risks for Africa, unless a rapid decarbonization shock occurs leading to large-scale cancellation of the fossil fuel plants currently in the pipeline.},

	abstract = {Background: Estimating the burden of disease attributable to long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in ambient air requires knowledge of both the shape and magnitude of the relative risk (RR) function. However, adequate direct evidence to identify the shape of the mortality RR functions at the high ambient concentrations observed in many places in the world is lacking.Objective: We developed RR functions over the entire global exposure range for causes of mortality in adults: ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC). We also developed RR functions for the incidence of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) that can be used to estimate mortality and lost-years of healthy life in children {\textless} 5 years of age.Methods: We fit an integrated exposure–response (IER) model by integrating available RR information from studies of ambient air pollution (AAP), second hand tobacco smoke, household solid cooking fuel, and active smoking (AS). AS exposures were converted to estimated annual PM2.5 exposure equivalents using inhaled doses of particle mass. We derived population attributable fractions (PAFs) for every country based on estimated worldwide ambient PM2.5 concentrations.Results: The IER model was a superior predictor of RR compared with seven other forms previously used in burden assessments. The percent PAF attributable to AAP exposure varied among countries from 2 to 41 for IHD, 1 to 43 for stroke, {\textless} 1 to 21 for COPD, {\textless} 1 to 25 for LC, and {\textless} 1 to 38 for ALRI.Conclusions: We developed a fine particulate mass–based RR model that covered the global range of exposure by integrating RR information from different combustion types that generate emissions of particulate matter. The model can be updated as new RR information becomes available.Citation: Burnett RT, Pope CA III, Ezzati M, Olives C, Lim SS, Mehta S, Shin HH, Singh G, Hubbell B, Brauer M, Anderson HR, Smith KR, Balmes JR, Bruce NG, Kan H, Laden F, Prüss-Ustün A, Turner MC, Gapstur SM, Diver WR, Cohen A. 2014.

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Approximately 3 billion people worldwide rely on coal and biomass fuel for cooking and heating. Biomass smoke exposure is associated with several chronic lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, usual interstitial pneumonitis, hut lung, and bronchial anthracofibrosis. Household air pollution primarily from biomass smoke is the biggest risk factor for COPD worldwide. Despite the significant burden of biomass smoke-related respiratory disease, the exposure is still underappreciated worldwide, especially in high-income countries.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature highlights the immunoinflammatory differences between biomass smoke-related COPD and tobacco smoke-related COPD that may lead to better understanding of the differences in the clinical phenotypes between the two entities, suggests an association with the recently recognized asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, and elucidates the burden of disease in high-income countries.
SUMMARY: The current review focuses on the association between biomass smoke and common chronic respiratory diseases, discuss differences between biomass smoke-related COPD and tobacco smoke-related COPD, highlights chronic respiratory diseases that are specific for biomass smoke exposure such as hut lung and bronchial anthracofibrosis, and discusses the known impact of beneficial interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 13th leading cause of burden of disease worldwide and is expected to become 5th by 2020. Biomass fuel combustion significantly contributes to COPD, although smoking is recognized as the most important risk factor. Rural women in developing countries bear the largest share of this burden resulting from chronic exposures to biomass fuel smoke. Although there is considerable strength of evidence for the association between COPD and biomass smoke exposure, limited information is available on the background prevalence of COPD in these populations.
OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of COPD and its associated factors among non-smoking rural women in Tiruvallur district of Tamilnadu in Southern India.
DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 900 non-smoking women aged above 30 years, from 45 rural villages of Tiruvallur district of Tamilnadu in Southern India in the period between January and May 2007. COPD assessments were done using a combination of clinical examination and spirometry. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between COPD and use of biomass for cooking. R software was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of COPD in this study was found to be 2.44\% (95\% CI: 1.43-3.45). COPD prevalence was higher in biomass fuel users than the clean fuel users 2.5 vs. 2\%, (OR: 1.24; 95\% CI: 0.36-6.64) and it was two times higher (3\%) in women who spend {\textgreater}2 hours/day in the kitchen involved in cooking. Use of solid fuel was associated with higher risk for COPD, although no statistically significant results were obtained in this study.
CONCLUSION: The estimates generated in this study will contribute significantly to the growing database of available information on COPD prevalence in rural women. Moreover, with concomitant indoor air pollution measurements, it may be possible to increase the resolution of the association between biomass use and COPD prevalence and refine available attributable burden of disease estimates.},

	abstract = {Most of the research around the world has been on outdoor air pollution, but in India we have a more severe problem of Indoor Air Pollution (IAP). The foremost factor cited for is burning of fossil fuels for cooking. Among the 70\% of the country's rural population, about 80\% households rely on biomass fuel making India to top the list of countries with largest population lacking access to cleaner fuel for cooking. 4 million deaths and 5\% disability-adjusted life-years is an upshot of exposure to IAP from unhealthy cooking making it globally the most critical environmental risk factor. India alone bears the highest burden (28\% needless deaths) among developing countries. Moreover, about ¼ of ambient PM2.5 in the country comes from household cookfuels. These considerations have prompted the discussion of the present knowledge on the disastrous health effects of pollutants emitted by biomass combustion in India. Additionally, Particulate Matter as an indoor air pollutant is highlighted with main focus on its spatial temporal variation and some recent Indian studies are further explored. As there are no specific norms for IAP in India, urgent need has arisen for implementing the strategies to create public awareness. Moreover improvement in ventilation and modification in the pattern of fuel will also contribute to eradicate this national health issue.},

	abstract = {The paper sets out a proposal for bridging and linking three approaches to the analysis of transitions to sustainable and low-carbon societies: quantitative systems modelling; socio-technical transition analysis; and initiative-based learning. We argue that each of these approaches presents a partial and incomplete picture, which has implications for the quality and usefulness of the insights they can deliver for policy and practice. A framework for bridging these different approaches promises to enrich each of the approaches, while providing the basis for a more robust and complete analysis of sustainable transitions pathways that serves better to address questions and dilemmas faced by decision-makers and practitioners. We elaborate five key challenges for the analysis and governance of transitions pathways, and compare the three approaches in relation to each of these. We suggest an integration strategy based on alignment, bridging, and iteration, arguing that a structured dialogue between practitioners of different approaches is needed. In practical terms, such a dialogue would be organised around three areas of joint knowledge production: defining common analytical or governance problems to be tackled through integration; establishing shared concepts (boundary objects); and establishing operational bridging devices (data and metrics, pathways evaluation and their delivery). Such processes could include experts and societal partners. We draw conclusions about future research perspectives and the role of analysis in transitions governance.},

	abstract = {Spicier food in hot countries has been explained in terms of natural selection on human cultures, with spices with antimicrobial effects considered to be an adaptation to increased risk of foodborne infection. However, correlations between culture and environment are difficult to interpret, because many cultural traits are inherited together from shared ancestors, neighbouring cultures are exposed to similar conditions, and many cultural and environmental variables show strong covariation. Here, using a global dataset of 33,750 recipes from 70 cuisines containing 93 different spices, we demonstrate that variation in spice use is not explained by temperature and that spice use cannot be accounted for by diversity of cultures, plants, crops or naturally occurring spices. Patterns of spice use are not consistent with an infection-mitigation mechanism, but are part of a broader association between spice, health, and poverty. This study highlights the challenges inherent in interpreting patterns of human cultural variation in terms of evolutionary pressures. Spices with antimicrobial effects have been considered to be a Darwinian adaptation to reduce risk of foodborne infection. Bromham et al. analyse more than 30,000 recipes and find that spice use is more strongly associated with socioeconomic factors than infectious disease.},

By comparing the well-studied actions of another industry (Big Tobacco) to the current actions of Big Tech we see similar strategies employed by both industries.

We examine the funding of academic research as a tool used by Big Tech to put forward a socially responsible public image, influence events hosted by and decisions made by funded universities, influence the research questions and plans of individual scientists, and discover receptive academics who can be leveraged. We demonstrate, how Big Tech can affect academia from the institutional level down to individual researchers. Thus, we believe that it is vital, particularly for universities and other institutions of higher learning, to discuss the appropriateness and the tradeoffs of accepting funding from Big Tech, and what limitations or conditions should be put in place.},

It will trigger a multi-fold increase in cooling demand, especially at a residential level, mitigation to which remains a policy and research gap. This study forwards a novel residential energy stress mitigation framework called REST to estimate warming climate-induced energy stress in residential buildings using a GIS-driven urban heat island and energy modelling approach. REST further estimates rooftop solar potential to enable solar photo-voltaic (PV) based decentralised energy solutions and establish an optimised routine for peer-to-peer energy sharing at a neighbourhood scale. The optimised network is classified through a decision tree algorithm to derive sustainability rules for mitigating energy stress at an urban planning scale. These sustainability rules established distributive energy justice variables in urban planning context. The REST framework is applied as a proof-of-concept on a future smart city of India, named Amaravati. Results show that cooling energy stress can be reduced by 80 \% in the study area through sensitive use of planning variables like Floor Space Index (FSI) and built-up density. It has crucial policy implications towards the design and implementation of a national level cooling action plans in the future cities of the Global South to meet the UN-SDG – 7 (clean and affordable energy) and SDG – 11 (sustainable cities and communities) targets.},

	abstract = {Nearly half of the world׳s population does not have access to cleaner cooking fuels, and this is attributed to several things including the lack of resources (fuel), infrastructure (production and distribution), purchasing power (poverty), relevant policies, and a combination of these reasons. A household׳s fuel choice aims to minimize cost and maximize benefit, both of which are intricate functions of many factors. The factors influencing a household׳s fuel preference, and how manipulating these factors such as subsidies, improved distribution networks and user awareness will affect fuel preference is reported. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) model was developed to study the fuel preferences of rural Indian households. Seven cooking fuels (biomass (wood and crop residue), dung, charcoal, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biogas, kerosene and electricity) were ranked in order of household preference. Various scenarios were considered to demonstrate the sensitivity of fuel preference to multiple factors such as subsidies and improvement in cooking technology. Results obtained from the model demonstrated strong agreement with the current fuel usage pattern in rural India. The model was then applied to compare traditional cookstoves (TCS) to non-subsidized improved cookstoves (ICS). The benefit-to-cost ratio of solid fuels when used in ICS was lower than that when used in TCS. A similar trend was observed for fully-subsidized ICS; indicating that price is not the only obstacle to the adoption of an ICS. Sensitivity analysis was performed to demonstrate the utility of this CBA model in framing policies to promote fuel transition in rural India. Although providing subsidies on LPG and electricity can make these cleaner fuels an attractive option, biomass will remain a household׳s preferred fuel unless distribution networks and infrastructure is developed to ensure their uninterrupted supply and accessibility.},

Lacking, however, are insights into fundamental questions about the role of historical housing policies in cauterizing current exposure to climate inequities like intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between \&ldquo;redlining\&rdquo;, or the historical practice of refusing home loans or insurance to whole neighborhoods based on a racially motivated perception of safety for investment, with present-day summertime intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two questions: (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate to current patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these patterns vary by US Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that 94\% of studied areas display consistent city-scale patterns of elevated land surface temperatures in formerly redlined areas relative to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as 7 \&deg;C. Regionally, Southeast and Western cities display the greatest differences while Midwest cities display the least. Nationally, land surface temperatures in redlined areas are approximately 2.6 \&deg;C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While these trends are partly attributable to the relative preponderance of impervious land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also examine, other factors may also be driving these differences. This study reveals that historical housing policies may, in fact, be directly responsible for disproportionate exposure to current heat events.},

	abstract = {Background
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 comparative risk assessment (CRA) is a comprehensive approach to risk factor quantification that offers a useful tool for synthesising evidence on risks and risk–outcome associations. With each annual GBD study, we update the GBD CRA to incorporate improved methods, new risks and risk–outcome pairs, and new data on risk exposure levels and risk–outcome associations.
Methods
We used the CRA framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or groups of risks from 1990 to 2017. This study included 476 risk–outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from 46 749 randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We explored the relationship between development and risk exposure by modelling the relationship between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and risk-weighted exposure prevalence and estimated expected levels of exposure and risk-attributable burden by SDI. Finally, we explored temporal changes in risk-attributable DALYs by decomposing those changes into six main component drivers of change as follows: (1) population growth; (2) changes in population age structures; (3) changes in exposure to environmental and occupational risks; (4) changes in exposure to behavioural risks; (5) changes in exposure to metabolic risks; and (6) changes due to all other factors, approximated as the risk-deleted death and DALY rates, where the risk-deleted rate is the rate that would be observed had we reduced the exposure levels to the TMREL for all risk factors included in GBD 2017.
Findings
In 2017, 34·1 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 33·3–35·0) deaths and 1·21 billion (1·14–1·28) DALYs were attributable to GBD risk factors. Globally, 61·0\% (59·6–62·4) of deaths and 48·3\% (46·3–50·2) of DALYs were attributed to the GBD 2017 risk factors. When ranked by risk-attributable DALYs, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) was the leading risk factor, accounting for 10·4 million (9·39–11·5) deaths and 218 million (198–237) DALYs, followed by smoking (7·10 million [6·83–7·37] deaths and 182 million [173–193] DALYs), high fasting plasma glucose (6·53 million [5·23–8·23] deaths and 171 million [144–201] DALYs), high body-mass index (BMI; 4·72 million [2·99–6·70] deaths and 148 million [98·6–202] DALYs), and short gestation for birthweight (1·43 million [1·36–1·51] deaths and 139 million [131–147] DALYs). In total, risk-attributable DALYs declined by 4·9\% (3·3–6·5) between 2007 and 2017. In the absence of demographic changes (ie, population growth and ageing), changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs would have led to a 23·5\% decline in DALYs during that period. Conversely, in the absence of changes in risk exposure and risk-deleted DALYs, demographic changes would have led to an 18·6\% increase in DALYs during that period. The ratios of observed risk exposure levels to exposure levels expected based on SDI (O/E ratios) increased globally for unsafe drinking water and household air pollution between 1990 and 2017. This result suggests that development is occurring more rapidly than are changes in the underlying risk structure in a population. Conversely, nearly universal declines in O/E ratios for smoking and alcohol use indicate that, for a given SDI, exposure to these risks is declining. In 2017, the leading Level 4 risk factor for age-standardised DALY rates was high SBP in four super-regions: central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; north Africa and Middle East; south Asia; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania. The leading risk factor in the high-income super-region was smoking, in Latin America and Caribbean was high BMI, and in sub-Saharan Africa was unsafe sex. O/E ratios for unsafe sex in sub-Saharan Africa were notably high, and those for alcohol use in north Africa and the Middle East were notably low.
Interpretation
By quantifying levels and trends in exposures to risk factors and the resulting disease burden, this assessment offers insight into where past policy and programme efforts might have been successful and highlights current priorities for public health action. Decreases in behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks have largely offset the effects of population growth and ageing, in relation to trends in absolute burden. Conversely, the combination of increasing metabolic risks and population ageing will probably continue to drive the increasing trends in non-communicable diseases at the global level, which presents both a public health challenge and opportunity. We see considerable spatiotemporal heterogeneity in levels of risk exposure and risk-attributable burden. Although levels of development underlie some of this heterogeneity, O/E ratios show risks for which countries are overperforming or underperforming relative to their level of development. As such, these ratios provide a benchmarking tool to help to focus local decision making. Our findings reinforce the importance of both risk exposure monitoring and epidemiological research to assess causal connections between risks and health outcomes, and they highlight the usefulness of the GBD study in synthesising data to draw comprehensive and robust conclusions that help to inform good policy and strategic health planning.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Exposure to household air pollution (HAP) from cooking with dirty fuels is a leading health risk factor within Asia, Africa and Central/South America. The concentration of particulate matter of diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) is an important metric to evaluate HAP risk, however epidemiological studies have demonstrated significant variation in HAP-PM2.5 concentrations at household, community and country levels. To quantify the global risk due to HAP exposure, novel estimation methods are needed, as financial and resource constraints render it difficult to monitor exposures in all relevant areas. METHODS:A Bayesian, hierarchical HAP-PM2.5 global exposure model was developed using kitchen and female HAP-PM2.5 exposure data available in peer-reviewed studies from an updated World Health Organization Global HAP database. Cooking environment characteristics were selected using leave-one-out cross validation to predict quantitative HAP-PM2.5 measurements from 44 studies. Twenty-four hour HAP-PM2.5 kitchen concentrations and male, female and child exposures were estimated for 106 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. RESULTS:A model incorporating fuel/stove type (traditional wood, improved biomass, coal, dung and gas/electric), urban/rural location, wet/dry season and socio-demographic index resulted in a Bayesian R2 of 0.57. Relative to rural kitchens using gas or electricity, the mean global 24-hour HAP-PM2.5 concentrations were 290 μg/m3 higher (range of regional averages: 110, 880) for traditional stoves, 150 μg/m3 higher (range of regional averages: 50, 290) for improved biomass stoves, 850 μg/m3 higher (range of regional averages: 310, 2600) for animal dung stoves, and 220 μg/m3 higher (range of regional averages: 80, 650) for coal stoves. The modeled global average female/kitchen exposure ratio was 0.40. Average modeled female exposures from cooking with traditional wood stoves were 160 μg/m3 in rural households and 170 μg/m3 in urban households. Average male and child rural area exposures from traditional wood stoves were 120 μg/m3 and 140 μg/m3, respectively; average urban area exposures were identical to average rural exposures among both sub-groups. CONCLUSIONS:A Bayesian modeling approach was used to generate unique HAP-PM2.5 kitchen concentrations and personal exposure estimates for all countries, including those with little to no available quantitative HAP-PM2.5 exposure data. The global exposure model incorporating type of fuel-stove combinations can add specificity and reduce exposure misclassification to enable an improved global HAP risk assessment.},

	abstract = {There has been extensive use of segregation indices for measuring residential segregation since 1950s, with continuous progress made in the field. Recent developments include the propositions of spatial global and local versions of traditionally used segregation indices, which have opened avenues for representing and analysing segregation as a multiscale and spatially varying phenomenon. Much less explored has been the issue of how important research design choices, such as the extent of geographical boundaries, grouping systems and scales of analysis, can influence the measurement of segregation. This paper contributes in this direction by investigating the impact of such decisions in the outcomes of the indices of generalized dissimilarity (D) and information theory (H) using a set of sensitivity analysis. Using a comparative study between London and São Paulo as basis, results obtained with different geographical boundaries, grouping systems and scales for the two indices are analysed visually and quantitatively. Results suggest that although D and H depict the same spatial dimension of segregation (unevenness/clustering), they present different sensitivity to geographical boundaries and grouping systems. The study also revealed how the two indices unfold different aspects of the segregation, which impact on their interpretation and applicability. The study concludes with a discussion of the considerations on research design choices concerning the interpretation of the results, which indicate the two indices should not be used interchangeably.},

	abstract = {A well-known limitation of commonly used segregation measures is their inability to describe patterns at multiple scales. Multi-level modeling approaches can describe how different levels of geography contribute to segregation, but may be difficult to interpret for non-technical audiences and have rarely been applied in the US context. This paper provides a readily interpretable description of multi-scale Black–non-Black segregation in the United States using a multi-level modeling approach and the most recent Census data available. We fit a three-level random intercept multi-level logistic regression model predicting the proportion of the population that is Black (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) at the block group level, with block groups nested in tracts and tracts nested in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). For the 102 largest MSAs in the United States, we then estimated the extent to which micro- versus meso-level variability drives overall racial residential patterning within the MSA. Finally, we created a typology of racial residential patterning within MSAs based on the total proportion of the MSA population that is Black and the relative contribution of block groups (micro) versus tracts (meso) in driving variation. We find that nearly 80\% of the national variation in the geographic concentration of Black residents is driven by within-MSA, tract-level processes. However, the relative contribution of small versus larger scales to within-MSA segregation varies substantially across metropolitan areas. We detect five meaningfully different types of metropolitan segregation across the largest MSAs. Multi-level descriptions of segregation may help planners and policymakers understand how and why segregated residential patterns are evolving in different places and could provide important insights into interventions that could improve integration at multiple scales.},

Empirical studies show that income level and inequality are positively correlated with urban sprawl and income segregation, respectively. However, the relationship between urban sprawl and income segregation is not only rarely investigated but also shows ambiguous empirical results when it is. Therefore, in this study, we built a stylized agent-based model with individual behaviours based on Alonso’s bid rent theory and ran simulations with different combinations of income level and income inequality. We measured the overall emergent patterns with indicators for urban sprawl and income segregation. The model confirms the established positive correlations between income level and urban sprawl and between income inequality and segregation. Furthermore, the model shows a negative correlation between urban sprawl and income segregation under free market conditions. The model indicates that without any policy implementation, a city will either suffer from urban sprawl or income segregation. Thus, this study serves as a starting point to study the effects of different urban planning policies on these two urban problems.},

	abstract = {As rapid urbanization and population growth have become global issues, urban growth modeling has become an essential tool for decision-makers to understand how urban growth works in overall dense environments and to assess the sustainability of current urban forms. However, in urban growth models (particularly when incorporating quantitative approaches to include driving factors of urban growth), spatial autocorrelation may influence the overall model performance. In this paper, an empirical study was conducted in the region of Munich, and an integrated urban growth model was tested to explain current urban growth. The modeling contributes to advances in the state of the art by combining a range of driving factors using autologistic regression with a transition probability matrix from the Markov chain method in a cellular automata model simulation. The autologistic regression employed here addresses the impact of spatial autocorrelation compared to ordinary logistic regression. Furthermore, this study compared modeling of overall settlement growth with modeling high- and low-density settlement types separately. Incorporating spatial dependency into the model through application of autologistic regression showed improvements when compared to the ordinary logistic regression model. The Kappa indexes were higher when separately modeling the two types of settlement density compared to modeling overall settlement growth since the driving factors of settlement growth of different densities might be different. From an urban planning perspective, this novel autologistic regression-Markov chain-based cellular automata model is a powerful tool that offers an opportunity for planners and government authorities to gain a more precise understanding of the different urban growth processes that might occur in an urban region similar to the one tested here. It should allow for a better assessment of the potential costs, benefits, and risks of corresponding planning strategies.},

We develop a model-based approach which explicitly includes spatial effects at multiple scales, recognising the complexity of the urban environment while simultaneously distinguishing segregation at each scale net of all other scales. Moreover, this model distinguishes segregation as unevenness and as spatial clustering in the presence of stochastic variation. The modelling approach, unlike traditional index approaches, allows hypothesis evaluation concerning alternative scales and zonation through an accompanying badness-of-fit measure. Ultimately, this permits the identification of the scale and zonation regime where the spatial patterns come into focus thereby directly tackling the modifiable areal unit problem. The model is applied to Indian ethnicity in Leicester, UK, finding segregation as unevenness and as spatial clustering at multiple scales.},

	abstract = {Although science has been a formidably successful force of social and technological development in the modern era, and a main reason for the wealth and well-being of current societies compared to previous times, a fundamental distrust characterizes its current status in society. According to prevalent discourse, science is insufficiently productive and in need of stricter governance and bureaucratic management, with performance evaluation by the means of quantitative metrics as a key tool to increase efficiency. The basis of this notion appears to be a belief that the key or only purpose of science is to drive economic growth, or sustainable development in combination with economic growth. In this article, these beliefs are analyzed and deconstructed with the help of a theoretical toolbox from the classic sociology of science and recent conceptualizations of economization, democratization, and commodification of scientific knowledge and the institution of science, connecting these beliefs to broader themes of market fundamentalism and to the metric fixation of current society. With the help of a historical-sociological analysis, this article shows that the current ubiquity of performance evaluation in science for the most part is pointless and counterproductive, and that this state of science policy is in dire need of reevaluation in order to secure science’s continued productivity and contribution to social and technological innovation.},

	abstract = {Energy scenarios, relying on wide-ranging assumptions about the future, do not always adequately reflect the lock-in risks caused by planned power-generation projects and the uncertainty around their chances of realization. In this study we built a machine-learning model that demonstrates high accuracy in predicting power-generation project failure and success using the largest dataset on historic and planned power plants available for Africa, combined with country-level characteristics. We found that the most relevant factors for successful commissioning of past projects are at plant level: capacity, fuel, ownership and connection type. We applied the trained model to predict the realization of the current project pipeline. Contrary to rapid transition scenarios, our results show that the share of non-hydro renewables in electricity generation is likely to remain below 10\% in 2030, despite total generation more than doubling. These findings point to high carbon lock-in risks for Africa, unless a rapid decarbonization shock occurs leading to large-scale cancellation of the fossil fuel plants currently in the pipeline.},

Moreover, this model distinguishes segregation as unevenness and as spatial clustering in the presence of stochastic variation. The modelling approach, unlike traditional index approaches, allows hypothesis evaluation concerning alternative scales and zonation through an accompanying badness-of-fit measure. Ultimately, this permits the identification of the scale and zonation regime where the spatial patterns come into focus thereby directly tackling the modifiable areal unit problem.

The method’s goal is to support urban design in terms of form, building systems configurations, as well as influencing user behavior aspects in the built environment through a systemic analysis of measured data to develop reliable future-case design scenario energy models. Detailed data on appliance-level electricity use are employed via data clustering to calibrate a urban building energy model for the Mueller community in Austin, TX, USA. The data were collected by the Pecan Street Institute for a year in 2014 from consumers in Austin and other surrounding cities. First, collected energy data were restructured and cleaned from corrupt and/or missing information. Second, in order to identify common energy use patterns, a model-based clustering algorithm for functional data was applied. Behavioral/usage profiles are determined through clustering and translated into usage schedules and behaviors. As a result, an urban building energy model built in the urban modeling interface (umi) was calibrated, with fully calibrated and semi-calibrated buildings, within a maximum calibration error margin of 14\% for daily-scale averages. Finally, an illustration of calibrated-urban building energy model design case scenarios is presented, and implications on community energy potential effects are discussed.},

Scaling analysis provides a straightforward method for the identification of network effects in socioeconomic organization, which are the tell-tale signs of cities and urbanization. For districts, a sub-state regional administrative division in India comprising both urban and rural regions, we find almost linear scaling of gross domestic product with population, a result quite different from urban functional units in other national contexts. Using deviations from scaling, we explore the behaviour of these regional units to find strong distinct geographic patterns of economic behaviour. We characterize these patterns in detail and connect them to the literature on regional economic development for a diverse subcontinental nation such as India. Given the paucity of economic data for urban agglomerations in India, we use a set of assumptions to create a new dataset of gross domestic product based on districts, for large cities. This reveals superlinear scaling of income with city size, as expected from theory, while displaying similar underlying patterns of economic geography observed for district economic performance. This analysis of the economic performance of Indian cities is severely limited by the absence of higher-fidelity, direct city level economic data. We discuss the need for standardized and consistent estimates of the size and change in urban economies in India, and point to a number of proxies that can be explored to develop such indicators.},

	abstract = {A well-known limitation of commonly used segregation measures is their inability to describe patterns at multiple scales. Multi-level modeling approaches can describe how different levels of geography contribute to segregation, but may be difficult to interpret for non-technical audiences and have rarely been applied in the US context. This paper provides a readily interpretable description of multi-scale Black–non-Black segregation in the United States using a multi-level modeling approach and the most recent Census data available. We fit a three-level random intercept multi-level logistic regression model predicting the proportion of the population that is Black (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) at the block group level, with block groups nested in tracts and tracts nested in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). For the 102 largest MSAs in the United States, we then estimated the extent to which micro- versus meso-level variability drives overall racial residential patterning within the MSA. Finally, we created a typology of racial residential patterning within MSAs based on the total proportion of the MSA population that is Black and the relative contribution of block groups (micro) versus tracts (meso) in driving variation. We find that nearly 80\% of the national variation in the geographic concentration of Black residents is driven by within-MSA, tract-level processes. However, the relative contribution of small versus larger scales to within-MSA segregation varies substantially across metropolitan areas. We detect five meaningfully different types of metropolitan segregation across the largest MSAs. Multi-level descriptions of segregation may help planners and policymakers understand how and why segregated residential patterns are evolving in different places and could provide important insights into interventions that could improve integration at multiple scales.},

	abstract = {Using unique household-level data from rural areas of six energy-access-deprived states in India, we examine the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for exclusive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking. We find that awareness about LPG's health benefits and diffusion of LPG within the community are the strongest determinants of WTP for exclusive use of LPG. Among demographic characteristics, only household size is correlated with WTP. Importantly, households exhibit significant price elasticity with regards to exclusive use of LPG. Households with irregular cash flows are less likely to pay for exclusive use of LPG. We find limited evidence supporting a negative association between availability of free biomass and the WTP for exclusive use of LPG. In contrast, higher household expenditure on purchased biomass is positively associated with WTP. Our estimates of mean WTP suggest that they are higher than the current effective monthly cost of subsidized LPG across households. However, they mask variation, and disaggregated estimates suggest that about 40–45 per cent of the households not using LPG as their primary fuel have a lower WTP than the current effective monthly cost of subsidized LPG and hence would need additional support to enable their cooking energy transition.},

While there exists optimism about the job creation potential of clean energy industries, just transitions literature has emphasized that the costs and benefits of energy transitions will not be distributed equally. Aggregate labor estimates hide the regional inequalities that might surface sub-nationally. We use the analytical framework to study India's power sector. Our results suggest that Indian government's 2022 target of 100 GW solar capacity will generate jobs primarily in western and southern parts of India as 60\% of the total jobs will be located in the states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka. If solar capacity addition targets are accompanied by retirement of thermal capacity, net employment impact will be negative with job losses being concentrated in the coal-mining states located in eastern India. Policy-makers can use this framework to identify the sub-national regions – states, districts, and counties – that will experience job losses due to energy transitions and estimate the number of jobs or economic compensation required for the negatively impacted communities. This framework can be applied to other industries and regions as well.},

	abstract = {With the world's lowest electrification rate, Africa is repositioning to offer its citizens a brighter future. Global renewable energy agencies and international financing to expedite rural electrification fueled by off-grid solar systems are attracting worldwide attention. Currently, 770 million people lack access to electricity on the continent, and more than 60\% live in poor rural areas where the national power grid is non-existent. The challenge herein is how to supply electricity to rural population, living on \$1.5 a day, at a reasonable power tariff. Although there are opportunities for off-grid solar energy to keep growing in sub-Saharan countries, it is impossible to ignore particular challenges in these countries. This paper focuses on three sub-Saharan counties: Kenya, Ethiopia, and Rwanda. Rwanda, Kenya, and Ethiopia foster off-grid solar systems as the primary solution through rural electrification programs. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the electrification experiences of these countries in terms of sources of funding, the challenges and opportunities they have been experiencing as well as an analysis of policy implications. The results show that off-grid solar systems improve health, ICT, and micro-enterprises in rural areas. However, governments should generate more robust developmental schemes that provide income to rural people that pushes them above the poverty line and enables them to afford off-grid solar products.},

We use a two-factor learning curve to model the decline in prices of wind and solar energies. Employing a real options approach with global coal prices as the stochastic variable we find the overall value of promotion policies in renewables to be sufficiently large. The trigger price of coal for investment in renewable energies today for electricity generation suggest early to immediate deployment of additional wind and solar technologies as the optimal policy. With the option to deploy for a longer time horizon, continuing with promotion policies of capacity additions and investment expenditures in renewables is more valuable at high global coal prices.},

This paper analyses the power supply situation in this region for year 2018 to evaluate the impact of renewable energy policies on energy costs and the resulting cost of avoided carbon. An optimisation model is built using GAMS. Model results show that the cost of absorbing renewable energy due to the “must run” policy for solar and wind energy plants ranges from \$1.9/tCO2 to \$4.5/tCO2 across states in the region, over and above the carbon tax of \$5/tCO2 levied on all electricity consumers in India through the coal cess. ‘Must run’ status implies that the evacuation of power from solar and wind power plants should not be curtailed for factors other than grid or equipment safety. The total additional cost due this policy ranges from \$200 to \$350 million/year. Inter-regional transfer of renewable energy after meeting the mandated renewable purchase obligations in the region, is suggested as one possible route to reduce the financial burden on distribution utilities. This would reduce the unit cost of energy by about 1–7\% across the states. Validating the model results against actual data for the year 2018 suggests that regulatory constraints and policy interventions have reduced the solution space for reasonable cost-based optimisation in Southern India.},

The results emanating from the ARDL bounds test provides evidence of a significant long-run relationship among the variables. Interestingly, it is observed that the foreign aid inflows, globalisation, and energy consumption significantly reduce CO2 emissions, whereas foreign energy aid inflows, economic growth, FDI and remittances inflows induce it. From a climate mitigation policy perspective, the results suggest that the Indian government can focus more on receiving the inflow of total foreign aid than foreign energy aid to improve the environmental quality. Given the potentiality of total foreign aid in driving the quality of the environment in India, it may be argued that much more utilisation of total foreign aid needs to be directed towards long-run investment on environmental sustainability enhancing-driven clean energy projects for an emerging economy like India.},

	abstract = {Energy is a key component for economic growth as well as for human development. India is the third-ranking electricity generator in the world but ranks 106th in terms of per capita consumption. Specifically, the distribution of power is the most important link in the value chain of the power sector since it is the cash register for the entire sector. In India, electricity is a concurrent subject shared between the Central and State Governments. While the generation of power has been deregulated since 2003, the supply of power to the consumers is generally carried out by Government-owned power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs). In this paper, the authors analyze the financial distress of DISCOMs in India, and explain how the supply-demand mismatch due to over-ambitious demand projections, the fixed and energy charges of thermal power plants, and the excess procurement of “must-run” renewable sources together contribute to the high cost of power procurement that drives the financial stress faced by DISCOMs. The authors support their assertion with a study of nine DISCOMs supplying electricity to 155 million people in three States and propose policy recommendations for a turnaround of such DISCOMs which can be rolled out with suitable modifications across India.},

Given the high income inequality levels in South Africa, this relationship was investigated at aggregated and disaggregated income levels. Based on an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, the empirical results indicate long-run cointegration between residential electricity consumption, gross national disposable income, electricity prices and food prices. Disposable income elasticities have a positive sign for the aggregate and all income groups, indicating that as income increases, South African households consume more electricity (normal good). As expected, price elasticities are negative and significant – for both the aggregated and disaggregated models – indicating that electricity prices do influence electricity demand for all South African households. The paper also examines the complementarity or substitutability of food and electricity. At both the aggregated and disaggregated income levels, the results showed that food and electricity are substitute goods for all South African households. However, as expected, the magnitude of this relationship is marginally different for each income group.},

Quadratic Engel estimates reflect households’ energy expenditures allocation decisions while the Probit estimates explore how alternate fuels are chosen by households for consumption? The Engel estimates highlight that the share of fuel expenditures in total household expenditures is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The computed compensated price elasticities suggest that Firewood and Kerosene are relatively more price inelastic in rural areas as compared to the urban areas. Furthermore, our estimates also indicate that cleaner fuels are more price inelastic in urban areas than in rural areas with inter-provincial variations in computed elasticities. These estimates can be used as an effective policy making tool for transition towards cleaner fuels, energy policy simulations, to evaluate taxation and subsidy frameworks and energy system forecasting to prevent environmental degradation.},

To account for possible reverse causality problems, we apply the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators with different specifications to verify the robustness of our estimates. In a scenario where the vast majority of the population has access to electricity, our findings indicate that an expansion in power provision reduces income inequality. Nonetheless, the higher the power infrastructure quality, the smaller the returns of a growing power supply to the reduction of inequality, thus suggesting that richer populations tend to benefit the most from improvements in power quality.},

An ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model is compared with the results of the Tobit model, using the combined dataset and the datasets for each country separately. House size, household wealth, education, occupation (clerical, sales, or agricultural), and gender of the head of the households are significant negative socioeconomic determinants of household multidimensional energy poverty. Place of residence, house ownership status, family size, and the age of the primary breadwinner play a significant positive role in multidimensional energy poverty. These results suggest that effective policy measures for improving the socioeconomic status of households will mitigate multidimensional energy poverty. With implications for the design and implementation of policy, the evidence-based results of this study will contribute to reducing the detrimental impacts of multidimensional energy poverty nationally, regionally, and globally.},

Electrification policy has historically focused on grid connections, however, rather than household capabilities to satisfy energy service needs. We explore a representative panel dataset of households from rural areas of six states across northern India in order to link distinct dimensions of electricity supply with electrical energy service utilisation. Using a regression framework, we show that household electrification policy in India must look beyond connections and consider disaggregate dimensions of supply, paying special attention to supply availability measured in hours per day. Following electrification, households surveyed were highly likely to utilise lighting and ICTs regardless of availability, while an improvement of 12 h was associated with higher likelihoods of space cooling (12.3\%-points [CI: 10.7 to 13.9]) and entertainment (13.4\%-points [11.2 to 15.6]) services utilisation. In contrast, mechanical loads, thermal loads, refrigeration and electric cooking remain constrained by household wealth and other factors. Disaggregate supply analysis supports the shift towards electrification policy that unlocks desired capabilities while using all available technologies, both grid and off-grid, to achieve more just outcomes for all.},

It was widely believed that Delhi's favourable geographical conditions for solar, relatively high literacy rate and good public awareness would aid good market penetration of rooftop solar (RTS). However, the expectations of the policy makers have been belied by a meagre adoption rate as RTS has met with a very lukewarm response from the residents of Delhi. The current study holistically explores the obstacles hindering the growth of Delhi's RTS market by integrating perspectives from solar vendors, implementing agencies' officials and users/potential users and suggests some policy measures to address the issues.},

We conduct a dynamic panel data analysis using data for seventeen major states in India for the period from 1992 to 2012. Our estimation results suggest that as the Gini coefficient of landowning rises, the agricultural electricity tariffs become lower. However, the rural population share does not significantly affect agricultural electricity tariffs. These results indicate that state governments are responsive to the demands of large farmers (rural elites) but not to the demands of farmers more generally (rural masses). Our results are consistent with elite politics but not mass politics. Low electricity tariffs for agricultural consumers have caused insufficient investment in the infrastructure necessary for the expansion of industries, as well as high electricity tariffs for industrial consumers, which may have adversely affected the industrialization of state economies in India.},

In addition, analysis based on geographical spread of energy poverty reveals that eastern states and north-eastern states are more vulnerable in terms of energy poverty, hence requires strategic policy actions at all layers of governance.

Any carbon mitigation strategy needs to alter India’s dependence on fossil fuels, requiring a systemic overhaul of its energy mix. Implementing a carbon tax will mitigate emissions and mobilise revenue. While part of this carbon tax revenue could be used to change the energy mix, the other part could be used for an in-kind transfer of free energy, up to a limit, beyond which it becomes fully chargeable from the first unit consumed. This we call the Right to Energy programme. We find that in order to implement this programme and also to meet the global carbon reduction goals, the necessary tax would be \$60.4 per metric ton of carbon dioxide.

	abstract = {Electricity for cooling improves health and quality of life and is an important mode of adapting to extreme weather conditions and to climate change. This study measures the change in electricity demand in response to weather shocks at the household level in Delhi, and at various aggregate levels in India. Our econometric analysis uses a semi-parametric model to capture the nonlinearity of short-run temperature response. On average, aggregate electricity demand in India increases by 11\% or more at temperatures above 30 °C from demand at temperatures of 21–24 °C, with substantial heterogeneity across states. Aggregate demand in Delhi increases by 30\% or more at temperatures above 30 °C. Using rich micro-data on electricity demand in Delhi, we do a first-of-its-kind estimation of household-level temperature response. We find evidence that low-income consumers, especially those living in slums, show limited incremental response to high temperatures, likely due to an absence of cooling options. These findings underscore the need to improve our understanding of the constraints posed by poverty on climate change adaptation, and for interventions to mitigate risks of heat stress among the poor. This also suggests rising affluence will lead to sharp increases in electricity demand for cooling.},

	abstract = {Measurement of energy poverty has been a missing priority in energy research. There is hardly any consensus regarding whether to consider energy as a resource or capacity, output or outcome, and quantity or service. In this paper, we revisit major approaches in literature to assess energy poverty: economic, engineering, and access-based, including others. We critique the economic and engineering approaches for the arbitrariness of cut-offs and the misplaced emphasis on less meaningful energy quantity. Finding the access-based approach most suitable, we propose a method of assessing energy poverty based on deprivation in modern cooking and lighting fuels. We divide the energy-poor into three groups: transitional, moderate, and extreme energy-poor. We apply the method to India's urban areas of different states and union territories using the national sample survey data. The results reveal energy poverty to be primarily dictated by deprivation in cooking and a greater incidence of energy poverty in larger states. In contrast to conventional measures, we compute the depth and severity of energy poverty only for energy-poor as opposed to for the entire population. These complementary measures depict energy poverty of energy-poor more accurately and therefore will direct the attention of pro-poor energy policies and programmes appropriately.},

Specifically, this study has attempted to investigate the effects of knowledge about energy issues, degree of concern, perceived energy-saving control, and sense of responsibility on energy-saving behaviors of urban residents in Myanmar. This study is empirically tested via multiple regression, using survey data collected from urban residents of Myanmar (n = 200). Results show that knowledge about energy issues, degree of concern, perceived energy-saving control, and sense of responsibility positively and significantly influence energy-saving behaviors. Among four determinants, the degree of concern has the most significant impact on urban residents’ energy-saving behaviors. Being the first empirical study that has explored the determinants of urban resident’s energy-saving behaviors in Myanmar, this study makes good recommendations for Myanmar policymakers in formulating and implementing energy-saving and environmental protection policies. Furthermore, this study intends to serve as a reference to stakeholders who are involved in enhancing energy-saving behaviors in the least developed countries like Myanmar.},

Empirical insights into the determinants of clean energy transitions are presented that highlight the need to recognise both fuel switching and stacking occurs in many rural households. It focuses on rural communities in India and illuminates policy dilemmas. The study reveals that fuel stacking is likely to remain a key part of the socio-cultural energy tradition that will impact progress towards low carbon and a cleaner energy transition. We therefore argue targeted policy interventions, multi-stakeholder collaboration and strong energy governance is needed to incorporate socio-cultural traditions particularly linked to cooking. This suggests new energy policy that must offer flexibility in order to achieve the twin goals of universal energy access and decarbonising energy systems.},

Very little is understood about what would motivate men to purchase CCS, and whether such motivations are key factors that influence a household’s decision to acquire CCS. There is a paucity of comparative analyses of men and women perspectives on this topic. This study adopted a qualitative approach to gain a first-hand perspective of men on this issue, and to compare findings with that of women in order to identify any similarities and gaps that could shape the eventual outcome of acquisition of a CCS. Contrary to published literature of women’s perception of men as being naïve to the challenges associated with traditional cookstoves, we find men in our study to be highly aware of such challenges, having experienced them as child-cooks while growing up. However, this awareness does not translate into an interest in purchasing CCS. While women expressed a strong desire for CCS, men who wield power over decisions to acquire CCS viewed them as status symbols, unnecessary and unattainable. This gender imbalance in motivation and power forecloses opportunities for household adoption of CCS. We recommend that programs should equally target men with CCS messaging, bundle cookstoves with other products that men value, and take advantage of women’s groups as a source of collective bargaining power for women in the acquisition of CCS.},

	abstract = {India has over 800 million people without access to clean cooking fuel. A well-known, but under-researched aspect of poor access to clean energy is its cost on woman’s health and well being. Here we use the nationally representative India Human Development Survey, tracking the same set of households from 2005 to 2011, to quantify the gender-related health and time-saving benefits of a shift in a household’s fuel and stove use patterns. We show that across India, the predicted probabilities of cough in non-smoking women are 30\%-60\% higher than non-smoking men in solid-fuel using households, but that a complete transition from solid fuels to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking reduces this gap to only 3\%. Exclusive use of LPG is also accompanied by reduced cooking time ({\textasciitilde}37 min) and less time for collecting fuels ({\textasciitilde}24 min) in rural households, together saving up to an hour in demands on women’s labour each day. We also find electrification reduces the probability of developing cough by about 35–50\% in non-smoking men and women across both rural and urban households, and help close the gap between men and women in rural households. Despite clean energy being a long-held policy goal of Indian governments, between 2005 and 2011, only 9\% of households made a complete transition to clean energy, and 16.4\% made a partial transition. We suggest that government efforts in India, and elsewhere, should focus on improving affordability, supply and reliability of clean fuels in enabling a complete household energy transition and help address key issues in gender inequality.},

A shift to advanced cookstoves can bring significant health and environmental benefits, but only with near exclusive use which requires significant changes in users’ behaviours. Since the emergence of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (now the Clean Cooking Alliance) in 2011, more attention has been directed to consumer and demand side factors in clean cookstove adoption and efforts to better understand individuals’ behaviours, household dynamics and decision making around the adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels have increased. This paper presents a review of the academic literature (2013–2020) and aims to identify the most successful interventions of behaviour change techniques in the adoption of improved cookstoves as well as the most common barriers to success cited in the literature. The study sourced 40 peer reviewed published academic papers from spring 2013 to summer 2020, and identified the following most commonly used behaviour change techniques in the adoption of improved cookstoves: Shaping Knowledge (n = 19), Reward \& Threat (n = 13), Social Support (n = 9), Comparisons (n = 4), Identity/Self-Belief (n = 4), Regulation (n = 0), Change in the Physical Environment (n = 2), Goals \& Planning (n = 6). Based on these results, we present gaps in the literature and provide policy recommendations to promote the adoption and continued use of improved cookstoves.},

The World Health Organisation recommends scaling the adoption of clean fuels to improve maternal and child health. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) represents a scalable clean fuel that provides health and environmental benefits when used for household energy in LMICs. In Cameroon, over 70\% of people rely on biomass for cooking, and the Government aims to increase LPG use from {\textless}20\% to 58\% by 2030. Supporting households make this transition requires involvement of multiple stakeholders and an understanding of perspectives from the community's perspective. We used visual participatory methods ‘Photovoice’ to explore households' perceptions of factors influencing the uptake of LPG for cooking in South-West Cameroon. Two groups of participants from rural (n = 7) and peri-urban (n = 8) areas photographed subjects they identified as preventing and facilitating LPG uptake in their communities. Subsequently, individual interviews (n = 15) and group discussions (n = 5) explored participants' reflections on the photographs. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo 10 software. The main barriers identified included difficulty in affording the initial LPG equipment and ongoing refills, scarcity of LPG retail shops and refills, and safety concerns. Facilitators included (i) increasing awareness of the benefits of LPG (e.g. health), (ii) increasing retail outlet density in rural areas, (iii) addressing safety concerns (e.g. replacing damaged cylinders), and (iv) reducing the price of LPG refills. Participants presented their photos at a public exhibition, which generated discussions with key stakeholders (e.g. government ministries) about how best to assist communities in this transition. Photovoice was found to be an innovative and effective approach for exploring how to advance equitable access to LPG from a community perspective and successfully engage with key stakeholders.},

The government has responded by promoting uptake of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by tens of millions of poor rural families. Many poor households with new LPG stoves, however, continue to partially use traditional smoky chulhas. Our primary objective was to evaluate three strategies to transition pregnant women in rural Maharashtra to exclusive use of LPG for cooking. We also measured reductions in kitchen concentrations of PM2.5 before and after our interventions. Our core intervention was a free stove, 2 free LPG cylinders (one on loan until delivery), and repeated health messaging. We measured stove usage of both the traditional and intervention stoves until delivery. In households that received the core intervention, an average of 66\% days had no indoor cooking on a chulha. In an adjacent area, we evaluated a conditional cash transfer (CCT) based on usage of LPG in addition to the core intervention. Results were less successful, due to challenges implementing the CCT. Pregnant women in a third nearby area received the core intervention plus a maximum of one 14.2 kg cylinder per month of free fuel. In their homes, 90\% of days had no indoor cooking on a chulha. On average, exclusive LPG use decreased kitchen concentrations of PM2.5 by approximately 85\% (from 520 to 72 μg/m3). 85\% of participating households agreed to pay the deposit on the 2nd cylinder. This high purchase rate suggests they valued how the second cylinder permitted continuous LPG supply. A program to increase access to second cylinders may, thus, be a straightforward way to encourage use of clean fuels in rural areas.},

Due to the large fiscal burden of the LPG subsidy, increases in electricity from hydropower, and other socio-political factors, the Government of Ecuador has launched a major induction stove program (PEC) to reduce the demand for LPG. We assess the effects of the LPG subsidies and PEC using government records, interviews, academic literature, newspaper reports, household surveys, and focus groups. Household surveys, conducted in rural, northern Ecuadorian households (n = 383), characterized cooking patterns and fuel access. Focus groups (n = 6) were carried out with a subset of surveyed households to better characterize survey findings. The LPG subsidy was developed as part of broad social support reforms in the early 1970s, without specific aims to reduce the health impacts of household air pollution from woodfuel or provide economic benefits as part of the transition to a clean cooking fuel. Nonetheless, the subsidy has resulted in nearly all Ecuadorian households cooking primarily with LPG. PEC has generated the sale of 740,000 induction stoves since its inception in 2014, short of the goal of 3.5 million. Among the rural households surveyed, LPG use, acceptance, and satisfaction was high, however, more than three-quarters of those surveyed reported weekly woodfuel use. Induction stove ownership (17\%) and use as a primary cooking fuel (1\%) was low among the rural households surveyed; furthermore, households owning induction stoves reported very low satisfaction with the stoves. Here we show that nationally-representative surveys reporting only “primary cooking fuel” use may underestimate solid fuel use as a supplemental household cooking energy, particularly in rural areas where fuel availability issues play a stronger role in decisions about what fuels to use.},

	abstract = {Approximately 3 billion people, most of whom live in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, rely on solid fuels (i.e. wood, crop wastes, dung, charcoal) and kerosene for their cooking needs. Exposure to household air pollution from burning these fuels is estimated to account for approximately 3 million premature deaths a year. Cleaner fuels – such as liquefied petroleum gas, biogas, electricity, and certain compressed biomass fuels – have the potential to alleviate much of this significant health burden. A wide variety of clean cooking intervention programs are being implemented around the world, but very few of these efforts have been analyzed to enable global learning. The Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network (ISN), supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and partners, identified the need to augment the publicly available literature concerning what has worked well and in what context. The ISN has supported the development of a systematic set of case studies, contained in this Special Issue, examining clean cooking program rollouts in a variety of low- and middle-income settings around the world. We used the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adaptation, implementation, maintenance) framework to coordinate and evaluate the case studies. This paper describes the clean cooking case studies project, introduces the individual studies contained herein, and proposes a general conceptual model to support future planning and evaluation of household energy programs.},

	abstract = {Close to three billion people globally and over 800 million in India are dependent on direct combustion of unprocessed solid biomass fuels in inefficient traditional mud stoves. Current cooking practices, besides causing serious health problems, are also being linked to emissions of climate change and pollution agents such as black carbon and ozone precursors. In India several initiatives have been taken up to tackle the problem but the present trajectory of limited technical and social change in cooking energy use is nonetheless persistent in rural areas. In order to develop and scale up alternative cooking technology options, we have analyzed, using the principles of strategic niche management, two projects implemented by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in nine villages in India. The assessment, while highlighting reasons for stability of the current cooking regime, also points to triggers that can destabilize the regime. The focus is also on assessing the influence of protection in the form of subsidies on the process of transition. User preferences relating to social and technical aspects have been analyzed, pointing to forced draft cookstoves as the preferred option notwithstanding cost reductions to address affordability concerns. The assessment indicates that while it is critically important to understand and address the preferences of users and to improve the technology, scaling up will depend on stove cost reduction through further research. Creativity in effective financing schemes and support structures put in place by fostering public–private partnerships are also needed.},

The potential for a transition towards cleaner and more efficient fuels and technologies is assessed by zooming in on three fuel-stove combinations. We find substantial demand and positive willingness to pay for the fuel-stove combinations in three locations representing different decision environments. Demand is significantly higher in the peri-urban and the resource abundant rural location than in the resource scarce rural location. The presence of better developed consumer markets for fuels in these locations functions as an important driver for cookstove adoption. Although charcoal and ethanol stoves are preferred over improved firewood stoves, continued firewood usage is expected. Energy switching behavior cannot be substantiated. Instead, energy stacking is more likely, where charcoal and ethanol add to and extend a household’s energy portfolio.},

	abstract = {Aims
Until now, the success of improved cook stoves (ICS) implementation programs has usually been measured by the number of ICS distributed. Some important research has been conducted to try to determine the effects of the use of an ICS in the user′s health, but these studies are expensive and time consuming. Moreover, no evaluations show the impact of the technology in the user′s lives. This study seeks to contribute to fill this gap.
Scope
By applying cluster analysis techniques to survey data, the most relevant variables that explain adoption and impact were identified. Using these variables, two qualitative indexes are proposed: The adoption index considers the use of the new technology, the level of satisfaction, and the conditions of the stove. The impact index considers the changes in cooking practices and life quality brought about by the ICS. Both indexes are then applied to two implementation programs. The indexes show the differences between the program results and the user′s perceptions of each technology.
Conclusions
The proposed indexes can be used to measure the success of an ICS implementation program in terms of the benefits perceived by the users of these technologies.},

This energy demand is mostly met by biomass fuels, which have many associated inherent disadvantages. Hence, it is important to understand the decision making process in rural households regarding the choice of cooking fuels. For this purpose, household information using the 61st round of National Sample Survey is analyzed for the rural parts of India. The logistic regression model is used to explain the determinants of clean fuel use for cooking purposes. The study shows that number of educated females between 10 and 50 years of age, average household education index, regular salary, and monthly per capita consumption expenditure have a positive and significant impact on probability of using clean cooking fuels, whereas possessing a Below Poverty Line ration card, belonging to reserved caste categories, family size and size of farm land have a significant negative linkage.},

Most cookstove diffusion programs focus on cookstove design, process of technology introduction, or market mechanisms. While such mechanisms are important, we postulate that a socio-cultural approach will go farther in informing programs that aim to diffuse cleaner cookstoves in developing countries. With our study, we step back from problems surrounding diffusion and deconstruct cultural beliefs that drive fuelwood and cookstove use in Lug Valley of Himachal Pradesh, India. The goal of this research is to understand the degree of consensus in shared beliefs regarding fuelwood use and cookstoves. Using cultural consensus analysis, we found an agreement amongst people for using fuelwood from forests and preferences for various cookstoves. We found that fuelwood use is driven by availability, lack of alternatives, and lack of infrastructure. Household factors like seasonality, cleanliness, smoke emitted, costs, taste of food influence choice of cookstoves at a household level. Cultural domains for fuelwood and cookstoves were independent from each other, therefore a holistic diffusion program focusing on cookstoves and fuel types is needed for diffusion of sustainable energy alternatives.},

	abstract = {In developing countries, woodfuels (fuelwood and charcoal) can contribute 50–90 percent of all household energy and contribute up to 8 percent of total household income. This demand for woodfuels is largely driven by 40\% of the world’s population dependant on solid fuels (primarily fuelwood) to meet their daily household cooking energy requirements. Absent major policy changes and sustained effort, the total number of households dependent on woodfuels is not expected to decline significantly by 2030. Efficient and sustainable management of forest resources for energy is thus essential in order to alleviate the negative environmental and social impacts that might arise from woodfuel extraction. However, long term management requires a deeper understanding of the local resource and the particular fuel collection habits of local populations. Yet, research on fuelwood collection patterns is limited, both in scale and depth. Previous studies on fuelwood collection locations have relied on self-reported data or large-scale analyses. Research on actual measured distance, location, or time required for collection is limited, particularly spatially explicit measures of collection. We add to this literature and fill the gap by applying home range analysis, typically used for movement of wildlife, to human fuelwood collection patterns in India. We track households using GPS loggers in five villages across three districts in India to cover a range of topography, forest resources, fuelwood demand and socio-demographics. We use the minimum convex polygon to map Resource Collection Polygons (RCP) at each of the five villages. We find that fuelwood collection is not evenly spread out among villages with distances for collection varying by the quality of forest resources available, nature of farm crops that can substitute for wood from forests, and also by certain socio-economic characteristics. Our research could be a base to build upon for further, more detailed analysis, and applied to understand other human behaviors such as food and water collection.},

	abstract = {A clean cooking energy transition necessitates effortful behaviour changes by cooks, financial decision makers, and other family members. A new inter-disciplinary CI-CHANGE model, rooted in technology adoption and behaviour change literature, provides an integrated framework to study the transition process. It provides new testable hypotheses on the how and why of the transition process using behavioural constructs such as perceptions and habits. In contrast, the current approach is to examine socio-demographic conditions and market/technology characteristics to identify- ‘who’ are likely to move away from solid fuels and ‘under what conditions’. CI-CHANGE combines elements of the Transtheoretical Model (health behaviour change psychology), Theory of Planned Behaviour (social psychology), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (information systems research) to identify \& prioritize intervention focus areas. Such framing highlights three key gaps in the current approach. First, based on process factor conditions of target audience, differential intervention strategies are necessary; second, post-sales interventions are required to support complex and effortful endeavor of accepting a new technology while fighting the old habit of traditional cooking; and third, entire transition process is fragile due to seasonal changes and no-cost reversal to solid fuels. Hence, long-term monitoring should back any intervention-specific climate/health gain projections.},

	abstract = {Because emissions from solid fuel burning in traditional stoves impact global climate change, the regional environment, and household health, there is today real interest in improved cook stoves (ICS). Nonetheless, surprisingly little is known about what households like about these energy products. We report on preferences for biomass-burning ICS attributes in a large sample of 2120 rural households in north India, a global hotspot for biomass fuel use and the damages that such use entails. Households have a strong baseline reliance and preference for traditional stoves, a preference that outweighs the \$10 and \$5 willingness to pay (WTP) for realistic (33\%) reductions in smoke emissions and fuel needs on average, respectively. Preferences for stove attributes are also highly varied, and correlated with a number of household characteristics (e.g. expenditures, gender of household head, patience and risk preferences). These results suggest that households exhibit cautious interest in some aspects of ICS, but that widespread adoption is unlikely because many households appear to prefer traditional stoves over ICS with similar characteristics. The policy community must therefore support a reinvigorated supply chain with complementary infrastructure investments, foster experimentation with products, encourage continued applied research and knowledge generation, and provide appropriate incentives to consumers, if ICS distribution is to be scaled up.},

However, exclusive adoption has been challenging in low- and middle-income countries. Previous studies have found that economic, social, and cultural barriers often impede adoption. We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 22 participants in a research trial where LPG was provided for free in Puno, Peru. We aimed to determine whether social and cultural barriers to LPG use persisted when monetary costs to the households were removed, and what factors influenced exclusive adoption of LPG in a cost-free context. Facilitators of LPG use included: support from study staff, family support, time savings, previous experience with LPG, stove design, ability to use existing pots, smoke reductions, desire for cleanliness, removal of traditional stoves, and perceptions of luck. Barriers to LPG use included: fears of LPG, problems with LPG brands, delays in obtaining LPG refills, social pressure, perceived incompatibility of traditional dishes, perceived inability to use clay pots, separate kitchens for LPG and traditional stoves, designated pots for use on the traditional stove, and lack of heat. However, these barriers did not prevent participants from using LPG nearly exclusively. Results suggest that social and cultural barriers to exclusive LPG use can be overcome when LPG stoves and fuel are provided at no cost to users and supplemented with behavioral support. Governments should evaluate the economic feasibility and sustainability of LPG subsidization, considering the potential benefits of exclusive LPG use.},

Drawing on examples of cookstove and product design, together with our experience in cookstove design, research and product standards development, we offer four suggestions for improving cookstove interventions. First, consider the benefits of incremental changes. Second, do not define the problem or the solution too quickly. Third, make no assumptions about how well you know the end user. Fourth, bring users, donors, manufacturers and implementing agencies into the design process. We conclude with a call for an inclusive approach to designing cookstove interventions that is centred around the lived experiences of users and rooted in context-specific knowledge.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how the diffusion of solar technology to low-income populations in India is shaped by people’s requirements for low-cost and adaptable energy solutions. Recent energy scholarship suggests that businesses selling high-quality, low-cost, functionally-fixed ‘standardized’ off-grid solar products at volume can drive the mass diffusion of solar technology to low-income populations. High-profile solar businesses operate under the assumption that with this model they can capture demand in ‘bottom of the pyramid’ markets. The paper firstly challenges the assumption of homogenous bottom of the pyramid markets that this model relies upon. Based upon empirical data from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, the paper then examines how solar businesses adopting this model have struggled, only selling significant numbers of units when subsidised. It looks at how informal shops are, in contrast, thriving by offering low-cost, improvised, and adaptable solar products, without subsidies. It shows how these products are meeting people’s requirements for low-cost solar solutions that are functionally flexible and which can be altered, added to incrementally, upgraded, and easily repaired locally. In conclusion, the paper argues actors working on energy access must re-examine promotion schemes and quality-standards that privilege functionally-fixed, standardized solar products. It suggests supporting modularity as one alternative compatible with demand for adaptability, both in function and time.},

Recent advancements in photovoltaic, light emitting diode and battery technology have resulted in the rise of affordable and innovative household electricity technologies, however penetration rates remain low due to complexity surrounding ‘last mile’ distribution. This paper applies the diffusion of innovations theory as a framework to investigate the ‘last mile’ challenges encountered when launching a Pay As You Go Solar Home System in a region of Central East Africa. The results indicate that Pay As You Go offers the potential to deliver a disruptive positive impact with regard to increasing access to clean affordable energy for the poor, however, both the technology and business model are more complex than current alternatives and therefore require a much more developed go-to-market strategy. The cost of achieving widespread diffusion is therefore higher than similar products sold at retail, yet this is balanced by potential for a much faster rate of adoption. Finally, this paper demonstrates the applicability of the diffusion of innovations theory as a viable framework for analysing last mile challenges associated with Solar Home Systems.},

In collaboration with a local social enterprise, Boond Engineering and Development, a small investment of USD 5000 was made to establish an energy center in the Unnao district of the state. The energy center became profitable immediately and generated seven dollars of business in solar home systems for every dollar invested during the 6-month evaluation period. Factors contributing to the success of the project included robust marketing, a strong banking partnership, the high quality of products, and continuous evaluation of staff performance. Challenges to sales of solar products included a bias in sales toward large solar home systems, the limited access to finance for poor households, and access to working capital. Overall, the energy center model holds considerable promise for alleviating energy poverty in rural India on a large scale.},

As momentum grows for this form of energy transition this paper draws together research on small-scale solar in six different countries – Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Mozambique, Sri Lanka and South Africa – to argue for a need to understand how, when, and for whom solar provides energy access. It argues that an assemblage perspective can provide vital insights into the diversity and dynamism of energy access. The paper demonstrates that the diverse ways in which solar provides energy access is a function of the flexibility/fixity of the socio-technical assemblage and the de/centralisation of agency. The central thesis of this paper is that energy access is fluid and ever changing and we need fluid, easily maintainable, locally modifiable ‘assemblages’ for providing such access. Using this perspective, we find three common features of solar energy access across our case studies. First, there are significant gaps between what solar projects are designed to achieve and what they deliver, which are highly contingent on the flexibility of their structure and the decentralisation of agency within them. Second, access needs to endure continuously. Third, to foster enduring access, projects should embed logics of improvisation. This paper is based on six separate qualitative research projects conducted during 2010–2016. It draws data from 482 interviews, 91 home tours and 12 group discussions.},

	abstract = {Public participation plays a crucial role in achieving Renewable Energy Transitions (RET). Existing research on energy transitions suggests that for seeking the active participation of all stakeholders, transition frameworks must be sensitive to the dynamic and complex interplay of power and agency. Knowledge politics that determine terms of engagement within energy transition projects often enable asymmetric agency resulting in vulnerability, exclusion and injustices. However, very little is known about how vulnerable and marginal groups resist subversion and re-define terms of engagement. This paper presents three cases of RET projects from India to engage with the interplay of knowledge politics, vulnerability and recognition-based energy justice. The cases bring comparable insights from RET projects on three different energy sources (second-generation bioethanol, advanced biogas and solar micro-grid), initiated by the government, industry and non-governmental actors in India. Based on the qualitative, empirical data gathered through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and ethnographic field observations, we argue that non-participation is a mode of resistance against subversive knowledge politics. Despite projected benefits and “apparent needs”, people do not accept the pre-defined roles and identities prescribed for them in RET projects. In contrast, vulnerable and marginal social groups mobilize their agency by framing needs and priorities in relation to situated as well as emergent social, political and ecological identities and demand for recognition-based energy justice.},

This study draws on 83 semi-structured in-depth interviews with 67 energy poor households in rural Lagos to explore what their lived realities reveal about the nature of their energy decision-making. We observe three important drivers behind household decision to consistently engage with a fuel-technology combination in practice: their organisation of daily life and by extension their vocational activity, the urgency of operating the service, and experience with and exposure to an energy service. Findings suggest that if traditional energy services are to be displaced, then in addition to using modern energy services to develop people’s lives, we need to develop people’s lives to use modern energy services.},

	abstract = {Urban building energy models (UBEMs) are emerging as a data-driven method for predicting energy consumption and assessing the impacts of policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions in cities. To date, the majority of these models have been developed for cities in the global north where urbanisation rates are relatively slow, the building stock turnover is low and data are relatively easy to obtain. As their use expands, they are being applied in faster-growing urban areas in the global south, where considerable investment is planned in capital infrastructure. This paper focuses on slums, which include populations that are hard to reach, underserved by current energy systems, and largely absent from UBEMs. It asks: what are the social, economic, and environmental implications of excluding slum dwellers and informal settlements from UBEMs used for policy development? If existing UBEMs do not adequately capture the needs of low-income urban residents, then planning decisions based on these models risk both carbon lock-in and deepening poverty for already marginalised groups. To redress these problems, this paper considers three key questions: 1. how informal settlements and low-income groups have been represented in UBEMs to date and the potential implications of their exclusion; 2. the politics, norms and behaviours of energy supply and demand within informal settlements; 3. what issues should be explored to integrate these marginalized housing groups within UBEMs. In conclusion, it calls for additional social science research to reduce the impacts of exclusion and to co-produce new methodologies with energy modellers. Future steps include fostering ongoing engagement with both expert and non-expert populations to facilitate citizen participation in evidence-based planning decisions},

This paper looks at women along the lifecycle of renewable energy from sites of extraction and generation to distribution and consumption. Based on eight published case studies from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, the study uses thematic analysis to examine: How are women exercising agency in different energy subsystems? And how does the transition in the various sub-systems affect women’s lives in general, and gender equality in particular? The study documents that womenmainly exert agency at local levels and remainmarginal actors with limited decision-making authority. It also highlights contrasting women experiences along the renewable energy lifecycle, with cases of resistance and alliance to energy operations, and experiences of more or less meaningful participation. The paper stresses thataddressing gender blindness in theenergytransition requiresmore than switching energy sources and increasing the number of women employed in the energy sector. I suggest that women may use civil society fora to join forces, present their local experiences, and identify ways to challenge patriarchal energy decision-making and promote justice in the energy transition.},

It focuses on rural communities in India and illuminates policy dilemmas. The study reveals that fuel stacking is likely to remain a key part of the socio-cultural energy tradition that will impact progress towards low carbon and a cleaner energy transition. We therefore argue targeted policy interventions, multi-stakeholder collaboration and strong energy governance is needed to incorporate socio-cultural traditions particularly linked to cooking. This suggests new energy policy that must offer flexibility in order to achieve the twin goals of universal energy access and decarbonising energy systems.},

Energy transition studies in Africa that have focused on the gender-energy nexus are mostly limited to rural areas. Further, debates persist about the conceptualisation of gender mainstreaming. This paper therefore builds on the emerging energy-gender-poor urban nexus research in urbanising Africa. We focus on conceptualisation and understanding of gender mainstreaming, energy security and poor urban environments, identifying the emerging issues and gaps in our current understanding of gender and energy research, and in framing further research in poor urban environments in Africa. Our central message is threefold: First, we need more evidence-based research on the gender-energy-poor urban nexus to understand progress towards universal access to energy for all. Second, we need to reconceptualise our understanding of gender mainstreaming as a long-term strategy aimed at bridging gender awareness into consciousness and daily routines. Finally, policies and research to improve energy security in poor urban environments need to shift the focus to securing energy services and to consider the gendered aspects of everyday energy use practices.},

This appears as a puzzle considering the benefits of electric lights. Using a panel survey of rural households in six states in India, we examine why some grid-connected households primarily used kerosene lamps for illumination. We use a logistic regression model to test our hypothesis regarding the relationship between primary lighting choices and electricity quality. The results show that household primary lighting choices are correlated with nighttime duration of electricity service, daytime duration of electricity service, and the number of days without any electricity connection, at the 99\% confidence level. Among these three factors, nighttime duration of electricity service has the greatest impact. To further promote the use of electric lights, intensive schemes to improve electricity quality are needed.},

We use an integrated framework (Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) ) to analyse Government of India's most recent and possibly the largest initiative for the provision of clean cooking energy - Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), and assess the extent to which PMUY is able to enhance use of LPG by overcoming the existing caste, class and gender-based exclusion. The analysis of PMUY has been supported through theoretical insights from the literature and empirical evidence from India's largest multidimensional energy access database – ACCESS 2018. Though the scheme recognises the pre-existing inequities, our analysis suggests a focus on caste, class and gender in the implementation procedures would be imperative for the scheme along with others focused on LPG access to achieve its objective.},

	abstract = {Near-term climate change mitigation calls for technological innovation and widespread implementation of appropriate technologies. This is salient in emerging economies, where impending socio-economic and infrastructural transitions hold immense potential for locking-in low-carbon development pathways. Yet, little is understood about how developing countries can scale appropriate technology transitions, given their often underdeveloped technological innovation capabilities and supporting infrastructures and finances. This paper examines a recent, rapid, and ongoing transition of India's lighting market to light emitting diode (LED) technology, from a negligible market share to LEDs becoming the dominant lighting products within five years, despite the country's otherwise limited visibility in the global solid-state lighting industry. Annual sales of LED bulbs grew more than 130 times to over 650 million bulbs between 2014–2018, with over 30 billion kWh of estimated annual energy savings. Focusing on this striking story of technology transition, this paper analyzes India's LED uptake using semi-structured interviews and drawing on the technology innovation systems literature. The results show that the success of transition coexists with its share of shortfalls, and that there is an important tension between the lowering of upfront costs of low-carbon technologies and the efforts to enhance domestic technological capabilities. The paper discusses the results for the Indian LED case and emphasizes the importance of consistent strategic action taking into account all (and not limited) parts of the technology innovation system, while also providing insights on how mitigation technologies can be developed and deployed in developing countries.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the persistence of charcoal use among the urban elite in Mozambique. The paper presents the results of a survey of 1036 households in three of the largest cities in the country: Maputo, Matola, and Beira. The analysis of the survey provides insights about the factors influencing fuel switching in these cities and the need to consider the spatial dimensions of the energy ladder model to develop a richer understanding of energy transitions in Mozambique. The analysis suggests that increases in income lead to higher levels of energy consumption. However, income is not a good predictor of fuel choices. Instead, cultural and generational factors seem to condition the use of different fuels, as reflected in the age and educational level of the survey respondents. The survey also shows that complex patterns of energy use support fuel stacking choices. Electricity is a versatile source in comparison to alternatives such as charcoal and liquified petroleum gas. However, while electricity seems to be increasingly used to heat water, it is more rarely used for cooking. Overall, the survey results suggest that spatial variables, such as built environment structures and household location, may also influence energy use patterns among the urban elite. The paper concludes with a call for qualitative and mixed methods research to explain how spatial variables and built environment patterns influence energy use in countries with low rates of energy access, such as Mozambique.},

	abstract = {Energy transitions from a fossil fuel-based to a clean-energy economy are required to meet international commitments on climate change mitigation. Energy-related policies play a paramount role to influence the pace of clean energy transitions. Energy policy makers must deal with operational, tactical, and strategic challenges due to an extensive range of deep uncertainties such as fuel price fluctuations, unpredictable demand behaviour, and climate change. Even though the future is uncertain, policy makers must design strategies to meet diverse long-term energy goals in line with changing societal needs. Analyses of the dynamics of policy decisions, economic development, technological innovation, social changes, and environmental impacts enable designing robust policy mixes consistent with clean energy transitions. A policy mix is considered robust, if the system of interest performs satisfactorily under a broad range of plausible futures. Thus, an integrated method is developed for organising energy policy recommendations to achieve robust policy mixes towards clean energy transitions. The method presented is an integration of energy transitions concepts, robustness-based approaches, quantitative simulation modelling techniques, and exploratory modelling and analysis.},

Many factors have contributed in bringing these changes. These include availability of energy, security of supplies, efficiency of use, cost of device, price of energy carriers, ease of use, and external factors like technological development, introduction of subsidies, and environmental considerations. The present paper presents the pattern of energy consumption in the household sector and analyses the causalities underlying the present usage patterns. It identifies specific (groups of) actors, study their specific situations, analyse the constraints and discusses opportunities for improvement. This can be referred to “actor-oriented” analysis in which we understand how various actors of the energy system are making the system work, and what incentives and constraints each of these actors is experiencing. It analyses actor linkages and their impact on the fuel choice mechanism. The study shows that the role of actors in household fuel choice is significant and depends on the level of factors – micro, meso and macro. It is recommended that the development interventions should include actor-oriented tools in energy planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The analysis is based on the data from the national sample survey (NSS), India. This approach provides a spatial viewpoint which permits a clear assessment of the energy carrier choice by the households and the influence of various actors. The scope of the paper is motivated and limited by suggesting and formulating a powerful analytical technique to analyse the problem involving the role of actors in the Indian household sector.},

The present study investigates the issue of accessibility of modern energy services in relation to three indicators—availability, affordability and reliability—and suggest practical ways of evaluating them, and identifies various strategies to provide them to the needy households in a cost-effective manner. Promoting the development of small rural enterprises is a key contributor to achieve this goal and a central aspect in this promotion is the large-scale diffusion of Sustainable Energy Technologies, which provide affordable and reliable services. The suggested framework helps the policymakers to identify technologies that are better than others under the present conditions.

	abstract = {The “energy ladder” relating improvements in socioeconomic status with transitions to more sophisticated stoves and to higher quality, less polluting fuels is often invoked as a theoretical model for analyzing household energy management practices. We report here on an integrated study of the energy, health and economic implications of fuel switching in the small village of Jarácuaro, Michoacán State, México, that challenges and extends the traditional energy ladder model. We monitored fuel and stove use, economic status, exposure to respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and trace gases (CO, CO2, NOx, SO2), and morbidity during both wet and dry seasons for a sample of 141 persons living in 21 homes. The families surveyed utilized simple “three stone” fires, traditional enclosed or improved stoves, and gas ranges or a combination of these technologies. In Jarácuaro, people who cook regularly are twice as likely as non-cooks to exhibit acute respiratory infection (ARI), (relative risk = 2.0, 95\% CI = 1.3 - 2.7). The use of improved stoves correlates with reductions in indoor concentrations of RSPs and CO, and decreases in reported cases of ARI, eye infections, and intestinal disorders. These changes are consistent with the technology component of the energy ladder, relating improvements in stove and fuel type to emissions and then to respiratory ailments. This suggests an associated “health ladder” for families adopting improved stoves or kitchen designs. We find that the energy ladder framework, while useful, is also an oversimplification that masks some of the strategies used in household decision-making. This is reflected in Jarácuaro where the socioeconomic correlate of stove “quality” and income breaks down: the more affluent families do not necessarily use cleaner fuel and stove combinations or invest in kitchens that are more healthy or energy efficient. Some of the most affluent households even exhibited the highest RSP and CO concentrations. These findings lead to a more eclectic model of fuel and stove adoption and use that has implications for integrated health and development policies. One direct conclusion from this study is the need and the opportunity for educational programs to facilitate transitions to more efficient stoves and cleaner fuels for the rich and poor alike.},

Two strategies are discussed for improving analysis. Using economic theory to guide the improvement of existing models can help, but conceptual blind spots will remain. A problem-oriented approach drawing on concepts and methods from across the behavioral sciences can avoid the blind spots, but cannot be systematic. Analysis can be improved by using both approaches in concert; some implications of a combined strategy are sketched.},

Foregoing immediate rewards for larger, later rewards requires that decision makers (i) believe future payoffs will occur and (ii) are not forced to take the immediate reward out of financial need. Low-income individuals may be both less likely to believe future payoffs will occur and less able to forego immediate rewards due to higher financial need; they may thus appear to discount the future more heavily. We propose that trust in one’s community—which, unlike generalized trust, we find does not covary with levels of income—can partially offset the effects of low income on myopic decisions. Specifically, we hypothesize that low-income individuals with higher community trust make less myopic intertemporal decisions because they believe their community will buffer, or cushion, against their financial need. In archival data and laboratory studies, we find that higher levels of community trust among low-income individuals lead to less myopic decisions. We also test our predictions with a 2-y community trust intervention in rural Bangladesh involving 121 union councils (the smallest rural administrative and local government unit) and find that residents in treated union councils show higher levels of community trust and make less myopic intertemporal choices than residents in control union councils. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of domestic and global policy interventions to help the poor make decisions that could alleviate poverty.},

On the one hand, it must meet the needs of 7 billion consumers (growing to 9 billion by 2050), including the currently unmet basic needs of large numbers in developing countries in areas such as food, energy, housing and health. On the other hand, it must achieve this growth without exceeding the resources available on the planet or causing environmental devastation. This paper argues that such change is possible through a systemic shift to a frugal economy that involves radical, frugal innovation across sectors. Such a transformation will involve the participation of large and small firms, consumers and governments alike. The paper introduces the notion of frugal innovation—the creation of faster, better and cheaper solutions for more people that employ minimal resources—and discusses strategies and examples of such change already taking place in core sectors like manufacturing, food, automotive and energy in developing and developed economies. It also outlines the role of the interaction between large and small firms as well as between firms and consumers in making change possible, as well as the role of governments in driving change where market mechanisms alone will not suffice.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Material demand reduction’.},

Social businesses in particular address a social need while generating profits typically reinvested into the business itself, but there is limited understanding of the ways through which social businesses achieve scale. This paper investigates how social businesses can scale up. First, we define scaling up as “increasing the number of customers or members of a business as well as expanding its offer and maximising its revenues until it reaches millions of people.” Second, using three in-depth case studies of social businesses that successfully scaled up according to these definitions, BRAC, Aravind and Amul, we identify scaling up strategies for social businesses. We identified market penetration, market development, product development and diversification as key strategies at different stages of business maturity. We find that there are two ways of increasing income generated that are linked to these four strategies: increasing revenue per stream and diversifying revenue streams. Our findings give insight to companies aiming to pursue social businesses and adds to the sparse literature on scaling up social businesses. A fruitful future research avenue would be to investigate the best sequence for applying these scaling strategies across companies and sectors over time.},

We articulate why this method is appropriate within the Indian context and highlight similarities between jugaad and related types of innovation originating from other emerging (and developed) economies. Next, we identify different types of organizations that engage in jugaad and elucidate their abilities, or lack thereof, to undertake such innovation. Finally, we incorporate the notion of jugaad within current theorizing on innovation and entrepreneurship and outline an agenda for future research on this topic. Overall, we provide insights on a mode of innovating that is increasingly prevalent in India as well as certain economies around the world and take steps towards integrating this concept into the mainstream theory, practice, and policy discourses around innovation and entrepreneurship.},

It is seen as the winning strategy to be adopted by manufacturers bracing themselves for dramatic performance enhancements to become national and international leaders in an increasingly competitive market of fast changing customer requirements. This paper identifies the drivers of agility and discusses the portfolio of competitive advantages that have emerged over time as a result of the changing requirements of manufacturing. The need to achieve the competitive advantages of manufacturing in synergy and without trade-offs is fundamental to the agile paradigm. To further the understanding of agility, this paper reviews the meaning of agility from different perspectives and suggests a comprehensive definition which can be adopted as a working definition by practitioners. Four underlining concepts of agility has emerged from the working definition and the paper presents a representation of these concepts and their interactions. Finally, the paper highlights some of the key enablers of agility and identifies potential future research directions.},

The purpose of this article is to analyze factors determining choice of energy source and labor input into fuelwood collection in poor, forest-rich regions, and to provide policy recommendations on ways to affect these choices. To this end, a nonseparable household model, reflecting choices in labor allocation and energy demand of rural households, is estimated from available data for three villages in a poor, forest-rich region in Jiangxi Province, Southeast China. Innovative aspects of this article are the analyses of factors driving household substitution between forest and non-forest fuels and of dissimilarities in household responses under different market access conditions.},

	abstract = {To understand energy access and consumption among rural households
at a granular level, CEEW undertook the first dedicated energy access
survey in India, ‘Access to Clean Cooking Energy and Electricity—Survey of
States’ (ACCESS), between late 2014 and early 2015. The survey was carried
out in six of the major energy-access-deprived states of India—Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal—with support
from Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, and in association with the
Department of Political Science, Columbia University. The framework used to
measure access to electricity and cooking energy was inspired by the multitier framework (MTF) proposed in 2014 by the World Bank and the Energy
Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). The ACCESS framework
lends itself to the evaluation of energy access as a multidimensional, multitier issue, going beyond unidimensional and binary definitions. On a fourtier scale, ACCESS 2015 showed that between 65 and 97 per cent of rural
households in the six states were in the bottom two tiers in terms of electricity
access, and between 91 and 97 per cent were in the bottom two tiers in terms
of cooking energy access. ACCESS 2015 highlighted the need to look beyond
connections and consider the role of affordability and supply-side bottlenecks in improving access to energy.
The report, as well as the underlying data, were used from 2015–2018 to provide tailored recommendations
to the central and state governments, with the aim of addressing the barriers to energy access faced by rural
populations in specific areas and regions.},

To this day, the empirical investigation of a global multifunctional city network remains a challenge given the scarcity of appropriate relational and multifunctional data sources. To overcome this research gap, we present an interdisciplinary network modelling approach that integrates methods from geographic information science with social network analysis, including automated semantic analyses.We apply our modelling framework to a globally available, user-generated database (ie, Wikipedia), still underutilized in urban geography and planning research. The proposed visual analytical investigation of the multifunctional world city network also includes a systematic evaluation to assess the robustness of the proposed approach, and the adequacy of crowd-sourced databases for scientific uses. By example, we discuss economical and political relations of a latent multifunctional global city network which we uncovered with our data-driven approach. Our results not only empirically replicate previously well-established world city network theory, but also generate new research questions about multiple functions of cities, as hypothesized in world city network research. Furthermore, we showcase the potential of coupling text-based user-generated data analysis with geovisual analytics for scientific investigations in urban studies.},

Based on a Twitter network in Brighton and Hove (United Kingdom), a creative hub, we identify freelancers and entrepreneurs in the creative industries that form the ‘core’ of the ‘creative class’ but have rarely been captured in existing spatial research. We use a comprehensive geodatabase of ‘Points-of-Interest’ and Census of Population residence and workplace locations to match tweets with types of places. Findings show that practices of economic creativity are less spatially clustered in central parts of the city and more spatially distributed across the city than studies that used business register data or cluster approaches suggested. Residential areas, which proxy for home locations, have a high incident of creative activities besides urban amenities and coworking spaces. It is concluded that local economic development should support the creation and maintenance of attractive places of social interactions across the city to foster creativity and innovation which has become even more important with the surge in homeworking due to Covid-19.},

	abstract = {The research presented in this paper addresses a current gap in the availability of building geometry data and provides estimates of individual building characteristics at city scale. Such data are crucial for a wide range of subjects such as modelling building energy consumption as well as regional housing market studies. However, such data are currently not available in the UK. In this work, a new approach was developed to automatically estimate the geometric characteristics of buildings, including height and floor count. A wide range of datasets have been brought together including high-resolution light detection and ranging data to accurately estimate building elevation and to obtain the external dimension of buildings. In the UK, most of the datasets required for this model are available for urban areas, allowing the model to be widely applied both in cities and beyond. The paper presents the results of building height and floor count determined from this model and compares these with the actual data obtained from a survey of 108 representative buildings in the city of Southampton. The results show good accuracy of the model with 97\% of the estimates having an error under ±1 floor and an absolute mean error of 0.3 floors. These results provide confidence in utilising this model for future building studies at a city scale.},

	abstract = {Urban scaling laws summarise how socio-economic behaviours of urban systems may be predicted from city size. While most scaling analysis rests on using aggregate quantities (total incomes, GDP, etc.), examining distributions of these aggregate quantities (e.g. income distributions) could shed light on how socio-economic inequalities may correlate or be causally linked to city size. In this direction, this paper examines how geographic distributions and spatial inequalities of income and housing costs vary by city size. The paper presents three principal results. First, it brings out qualitative implications of quantitative scaling by relating scaling of the distributions of income and housing costs to their specific geographic concentrations. Second, it shows that some small and medium sized cities are clear outliers, showing behaviour similar to the largest cities and starkly different from the behaviours of the bulk of small and medium sized cities. Third, this above observation explains why heteroscedasticity, or large and heterogeneous fluctuations, are frequently observed in urban indicator data when plotted as a function of city size. Putting together these three results, overall, it is shown that income distributions and housing costs scale and concentrate in cities by size in a predictable way, where the largest cities superlinearly/disproportionately agglomerate the highest income earners and the highest housing costs, and show relatively lower concentrations of low-middle income earners and low-medium housing costs. In contrast, most of the smaller and medium sized cities show a ‘flipped’ opposite trend. A few small and medium sized cities are outliers: they show trends that match those of the largest cities, due to specialisations of economic functions or concentrations of high-paying occupations in these cities. The empirical findings lead to a discussion on the objective and normative relationships between city size and urban inequalities. It is suggested that due to the concentrations of high income and high housing costs, largest cities may have a resulting housing market structure that will push out lower and medium income earners, thereby making affordability, diversity, and socio-spatial justice emerge as important urban policy issues.},

	abstract = {The field of urban analytics and city science has seen significant growth and development in the past 20 years. The rise of data science, both in industry and academia, has put new pressures on urban research, but has also allowed for new analytical possibilities. Because of the rapid growth and change in the field, terminology in urban analytics can be vague and unclear. This paper, an abridged synthesis of a panel discussion among scholars in Urban Data Science held at the 2019 American Association of Geographers Conference in Washington, D.C., outlines one discussion seeking a better sense of the conceptual, terminological, social, and ethical challenges faced by researchers in this emergent field. The panel outlines the difficulties of defining what is or is not urban data science, finding that good urban data science must have an expansive role in a successful discipline of “city science.” It suggests that “data science” has value as a “signaling” term in industrial or popular science applications, but which may not necessarily be well-understood within purely academic circles. The panel also discusses the normative value of doing urban data science, linking successful practice back to urban life. Overall, this panel report contributes to the wider discussion around urban analytics and city science and about the role of data science in this domain.},

This paper proposes an improved fuzzy clustering-text clustering method based on the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm and the edit distance algorithm. We use the feature evaluation to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional text vector. Because the clustering results of the traditional fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm lack the stability, we introduce the high-power sample point set, the field radius and weight. Due to the boundary value attribution of the traditional fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm, we recommend the edit distance algorithm. The results show that the improved algorithm is applied to the text clustering, making the results of clustering more stable and accurate than the traditional FCM clustering algorithm.},

The metric approach achieves its robustness with respect to outliers by taking into account a “robust” distance measure, the noise approach by introducing a noise cluster represented by a noise prototype, and the trimmed approach by trimming away a certain fraction of data units. A comparative simulation study and measures of misclassification and of robustness with respect to prototype detection in the presence of outliers have been developed.

Approaches to cluster such data are compared, namely a latent class mixture model assuming local independence and dissimilarity-based methods such as k-medoids. The design of an appropriate dissimilarity measure and the estimation of the number of clusters are discussed as well, comparing the Bayesian information criterion with dissimilarity-based criteria. The comparison is based on a philosophy of cluster analysis that connects the problem of a choice of a suitable clustering method closely to the application by considering direct interpretations of the implications of the methodology. The application of this philosophy to economic data from the 2007 US Survey of Consumer Finances demonstrates techniques and decisions required to obtain an interpretable clustering. The clustering is shown to be significantly more structured than a suitable null model. One result is that the data-based strata are not as strongly connected to occupation categories as is often assumed in the literature.},

	abstract = {The k-means algorithm is well known for its efficiency in clustering large data sets. However, working only on numeric values prohibits it from being used to cluster real world data containing categorical values. In this paper we present two algorithms which extend the k-means algorithm to categorical domains and domains with mixed numeric and categorical values. The k-modes algorithm uses a simple matching dissimilarity measure to deal with categorical objects, replaces the means of clusters with modes, and uses a frequency-based method to update modes in the clustering process to minimise the clustering cost function. With these extensions the k-modes algorithm enables the clustering of categorical data in a fashion similar to k-means. The k-prototypes algorithm, through the definition of a combined dissimilarity measure, further integrates the k-means and k-modes algorithms to allow for clustering objects described by mixed numeric and categorical attributes. We use the well known soybean disease and credit approval data sets to demonstrate the clustering performance of the two algorithms. Our experiments on two real world data sets with half a million objects each show that the two algorithms are efficient when clustering large data sets, which is critical to data mining applications.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

While climatic events, technologies, socio-economic indicators, and features of the built environment are the most researched drivers for space cooling, we offer an alternative, multidimensional review that places humans and their physiological interactions with space, culture and society at the centre of this investigation. We aim to expand the understanding of thermal comfort beyond the dominant technical focus and examine the broader, though largely underutilized, literature on material culture, everyday practices and sociocultural influences on how a range of human factors influence people’s preferences for cooling thermal comfort. We integrate these perspectives with insights from psychology and neuro-architecture to discuss the influence of space in the perceptions of thermal comfort beyond heat-exchange. We navigate the different studies reviewed from a variety of fields within the social science and humanities and argue that cooling needs and preferences are grounded in both cultural and corporeal perceptions, and are the result of individual subjective experience of external stimuli within the body, culture, space, and society. We argue that placing humans at the core of understanding the origins of cooling needs is key to enabling a more sustainable cooling future, and identify key areas of future research.},

This paper presents an area-based modelling approach to heat electrification using 17,741 dwellings in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne as a case study. The presented framework has been developed so as to address local energy policy questions on the impact of domestic electrical heating options. These questions reflect significant under-researched challenges such as the quantification of peak electricity demand for heat pumps based electrification options. The presented results show that the electrification of heat at city-scale will have a substantial impact on the local electrical grid infrastructure and provide a first indication of what the potential additional mean and (winter) peak household electricity demand ranges (i.e. 59–95\%. This is significantly lower than what might be ascertained from existing literature). Furthermore, the results show that emission savings will be achieved with all electrification options studied but achieving the city's ambitious decarbonisation goals will require more exploration of the urban energy landscape. The paper further underpins the significance of sub-city modelling by enabling policy makers to identify housing neighbourhoods at LV sub-station for area-based delivery. Finally, an integrated modelling approach to cope with forthcoming energy system design challenges at LV scale is suggested.},

	abstract = {From the outset of deregulation and privatisation of UK electricity markets, the desired extent of vertical integration has been debated. Concerns over the dominance of the “Big Six” majors and whether consumers were receiving a fair deal, led the new Government of 2010 to promote the entry of new retail supply firms without generation assets. Increasing consumer choice and facilitating supplier switching were seen as counter-weights to the dominance of the vertically integrated majors. Through various policies favouring new, assetless suppliers, the domestic retail electricity market in the UK has become less concentrated offering more choice to consumers. But the process of reducing market concentration has had setbacks: many new retail suppliers went bankrupt and service quality has been mixed. To address possible short-comings, the Regulator in mid-2019 introduced stricter requirements for a retail supply license but are they sufficient? Combining theory with empirical analysis, it is argued that enhanced requirements are unlikely to be sufficient to ensure the success of these new firms because assetless retailers face competitive disadvantages under the current market structure. Before debating the role and benefits of such firms, their economic viability should be assessed.},

	abstract = {The promotion of low-carbon home retrofit among UK homeowners is widely recognised as an important strategy to reduce operational energy use in dwellings and mitigate climate change. The related predominant UK policy approach is to address various market failures and develop the market for low-carbon retrofit and innovation. The current low uptake rate of low-carbon home retrofit suggests that a complementary policy approach is necessary to increase it and support households in their change towards low-carbon living. This paper uses an innovation framework to analyse retrofit as an innovation-decision process of several stages. Low-carbon technology is conceptualised at three nested levels: product, design option and technological system. A multiple-case study approach is used to analyse eight home retrofit cases from the SuperHomes network, that achieved significant carbon emission reductions through retrofit activities. Case analysis shows that: (i) homeowners collect information for each technology level through different communication channels, which are not interchangeable; (ii) homeowners develop a certain capacity to transform their environmental concerns into substantial retrofit activities; (iii) the positive retrofit experience of homeowners is crucial to develop such capacity and to convince others to retrofit their homes. These findings have important implications for energy policy on retrofit uptake in UK to support household transition to low-carbon living.},

Based on this original dataset, we find that poor housing is as important as low income and the use of natural gas in determining fuel poverty. In particular, the risk of fuel poverty is increased by i) the energy inefficiency of the home; ii) the size of the home in relation to household size; iii) the lower total household expenditure. Conversely, the risk decreases when the main heating is natural gas and/or the home is endowed with renewable energy sources. Our results show that information in EPCs, matched at the micro level with the socio-economic data usually available from administrative sources or surveys, can be used to identify - on the one hand - the individual households and the municipal areas risking fuel poverty, and - on the other - the most effective policy options to tackle the phenomenon.},

Two Landsat images from years 2003 and 2014 were downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer. Maximum likelihood method was used to classify the images into five classes: urban fabric, vegetation, water bodies, agriculture lands, and barren lands. Overall kappa accuracy measure is about to 87.60 and 86.15\% for the years 2003 and 2014, respectively. The change detection analysis has been performed for years 2003 and 2014 postclassified images. The results of the study have indicated that Coimbatore City has experienced rapid modifications in LULC, particularly in terms of urban/built-up area. Over the past 11 years, urban/built-up areas have increased by 94.5 km2, resulting in a significant drop in the area of agricultural land and vegetation cover. It is found that (1) urban areas are increased 200\% due to population growth cum rapid economic progress. (2) Vegetation cover decreased 38.76\% due to conversion into urban features. (3) Water bodies in area increased to 15.78\% due to eradication of encroachment. (4) There is loss of 1.89\% of agricultural lands due to demand for construction activities. (5) About 85.24\% of barren lands were converted into other uses, particularly 57.33\% to urban areas. (6) Urban growth has accelerated towards north-eastern, northern, and eastern parts, where national highways exist. The built-up areas were dropped from 85.32 to 22.28\%, within 5-km distance from the city center.},

	abstract = {In the medium access control layer (MAC) of WSN, the scheduling mechanism of nodes based on the periodical listen/sleep is an effective way of saving node energy consumption. In the case of data transmission which is not affected reduces the nodes’ proportions, we improve the protocols based on asynchronous MAC. This paper discusses a protocol which is a low duty cycle energy-efficient MAC protocol for WSN and can be adaptively updated based on the prediction nodes’ wake-up time. We call it AP-MAC protocol. In AP-MAC protocol, the nodes will not wake up or send data in the same period, and they will wake up in random time according to the algorithm that has been set. In this case, the network can avoid the problem of collision, cross-talk, etc. caused by all the nodes’ wake-up in the same time, and save more energy. To ensure the reliable transmission of network data, the node which sends data will predict the wake-up time of receiving nodes and ensure the receiving nodes wake up timely and establish a connection with sending note. At the same time, we join several adaptive update mechanisms in the network according to the dynamic changes of it. The experimental results show that the improved protocol not only can save the network energy consumption by effectively reducing the overall duty cycle of the network nodes and improving the reliable transmission of data but also can improve the adaptability of the network.},

	abstract = {It is known to all that mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is more vulnerable to all sorts of malicious attacks which affects the reliability of data transmission because the network has the characteristics of wireless, multi-hop, etc. We put forward novel approach of distributed \& adaptive trust metrics for MANET in this paper. Firstly, the method calculates the communication trust by using the number of data packets between nodes, and predicts the trust based on the trend of this value, and calculates the comprehensive trust by considering the history trust with the predict value; then calculates the energy trust based on the residual energy of nodes and the direct trust based on the communication trust and energy trust. Secondly, the method calculates the recommendation trust based on the recommendation reliability and the recommendation familiarity; adopts the adaptive weighting, and calculates the integrate direct trust by considering the direct trust with recommendation trust. Thirdly, according to the integrate direct trust, considering the factor of trust propagation distance, the indirect trust between nodes is calculated. The feature of the proposed method is its ability to discover malicious nodes which can partition the network by falsely reporting other nodes as misbehaving and then proceeds to protect the network. Simulation experiments and tests of the practical applications of MANET show that the proposed approach can effectively avoid the attacks of malicious nodes, besides, the calculated direct trust and indirect trust about normal nodes are more conformable to the actual situation.},

Based on local-world theory, an uneven clustering weighted evolving model of WSNs is designed. The definitions of edge weight and vertex strength take sensor energy, transmission distance, and flow into consideration. The vertex strengths drive the growth of topology; meanwhile, the edge weights change correspondingly. Experimental data demonstrate that the WSN topology we obtain has the property of weighted networks of the IOT: the edge weight, vertex degree, and strength follow a power-law distribution. Related IOT research work shows that weighted WSNs not only share the robustness and fault tolerance of weight-free networks, but also reduce the probability that successive node breakdowns occur; furthermore, they enhance the synchronization of WSNs.},

Because the adjacent subcarriers do not need to be orthogonal to each other in FBMC, there is conflict and competition, thus the evolutionary game theory is used to optimize the subcarrier allocation problem. We innovatively introduced the channel state matrix to show the quality of subcarriers. Considering the height of secondary user and base station’s antenna, the total data transmission rate limit, total power consumption constraint and power consumption constraint on a single subcarrier, a nonlinear fractional programming problem is established where maximum energy efficiency is the objective function, total data transmission rate limit, total power consumption constraint and power consumption constraint on a single subcarrier are constraint conditions. The utility function for each secondary user is established when the evolutionary game operator is designed. When the utility function becomes optimal, the evolutionary game reaches Nash equilibrium, and the strategy combination is considered to be the energy efficient resource allocation scheme. Through experimental simulation, EESA-EG proposed in this paper gives the most reasonable subcarrier allocation scheme, allocates more subcarriers for the subcarriers with better channel state and the energy efficiency in EESA-EG is optimal.},

	abstract = {During mobile edge computing, due to the movement of nodes and the exhaustion of node energy, link failure occurs thus reducing the network lifetime in the mobile ad-hoc network. When the route fails, because the single-path protocols need to restart the route discovery process, the delay of the network is greatly increased. Therefore, the multi-path routing protocol is proposed, saving the cost of route discovery. In this paper, we propose an ad hoc on-demand multi-path distance vector (AOMDV) routing protocol based on link lifetime and energy consumption prediction (named LLECP-AOMDV) for mobile edge computing. In the route discovery phase, the energy grading strategy is adopted. When the node energy is lower than the threshold, it no longer participates in the route discovery. In the routing selected phase, the path is selected based on the lifetime of the route link and the minimum energy consumption of the route. According to energy consumption, packet delivery rate, end-to-end delay performance indicators, we evaluate the comparison results. The result shows that under most network performance indicators and parameters, the proposed LLECP-AOMDV is superior to the other three protocols, which improves the network lifetime, reduces the node's energy consumption and the average end-to-end delay. The protocol is very useful for mobile edge computing.},

In this paper, we consider a typical delay-tolerant application scenario with a subset of vehicles, termed Vehicles of Interest (VoIs), having download requests. Each VoI downloads a distinct large-size file from the Internet and other vehicles without download requests assist the delivery of the files to the VoIs. A cooperative communication strategy is proposed that explores the combined use of V2I communications, V2V communications, mobility of vehicles and cooperation among vehicles and infrastructure to improve the capacity of vehicular networks. An analytical framework is developed to model the data dissemination process using this strategy, and a closed-form expression of the achievable capacity is obtained, which reveals the relationship between the capacity and its major performance-impacting parameters such as inter-infrastructure distance, radio ranges of infrastructure and vehicles, sensing range of vehicles, transmission rates of V2I and V2V communications, vehicular density, and proportion of VoIs. Numerical result shows that the proposed cooperative communication strategy significantly boosts the capacity of vehicular networks, especially when the proportion of VoIs is low. Our results provide guidance on the optimum deployment of a vehicular network infrastructure and the design of a cooperative communication strategy to improve the capacity.},

	abstract = {As a hierarchical network architecture, the cluster architecture can improve the routing performance greatly for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) by grouping the vehicle nodes. However, the existing clustering algorithms only consider the mobility of a vehicle when selecting the cluster head. The rapid mobility of vehicles makes the link between nodes less reliable in cluster. A slight change in the speed of cluster head nodes has a great influence on the cluster members and even causes the cluster head to switch frequently. These problems make the traditional clustering algorithms perform poorly in the stability and reliability of the VANET. A novel passive multi-hop clustering algorithm (PMC) is proposed to solve these problems in this paper. The PMC algorithm is based on the idea of a multi-hop clustering algorithm that ensures the coverage and stability of cluster. In the cluster head selection phase, a priority-based neighbor-following strategy is proposed to select the optimal neighbor nodes to join the same cluster. This strategy makes the inter-cluster nodes have high reliability and stability. By ensuring the stability of the cluster members and selecting the most stable node as the cluster head in the N-hop range, the stability of the clustering is greatly improved. In the cluster maintenance phase, by introducing the cluster merging mechanism, the reliability and robustness of the cluster are further improved. In order to validate the performance of the PMC algorithm, we do many detailed comparison experiments with the algorithms of N-HOP, VMaSC, and DMCNF in the NS2 environment.},

The communication of these devices are mainly based on the MANET (Mobile Ad hoc Network). Due to the mobility, self-organization and distributed control of MANET, the routing protocol of MANET has to adapt to the rapid changes of the network structure, and have to make sure the network resources being saved at most. The OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) is a representative table-driven routing in MANET, and the main technology of OLSR is MPR. In this paper, we improved the quantum genetic strategy, and proposed a new routing protocol named QG-OLSR by combining the characteristics of OLSR. The quick changes of topology of MANET make it a huge challenge to find and maintain an end-to-end optimal path, while heuristic Q-Learning strategy is able to dynamically adjust the routing path through interaction with the surrounding environment. New Q-Learning strategy has been embedded in our improved quantum genetic strategy. The QG-OLSR of this paper optimized the selection of MPR, overcomes the shortage of the traditional protocol, and proves the property of convergence and global optimization. The new routing protocol improved the performance of transmission. The simulation results show that the new protocol is feasible and applicable, and perform a better experimental result.},

Such a phenomenon is referred to as the ASE crash. We revisit this issue by considering optimizing the BS antenna downtilt in cellular networks. It is common to adjust antenna pattern to tune the direction of the vertical beamforming and thus increasing received signal power and/or reducing inter-cell interference power to improve network performance. This paper focuses on investigating the relationship between the BS antenna downtilt and the downlink network performance in terms of the coverage probability and the ASE. Our results reveal an interesting find that there exists an optimal antenna downtilt to achieve the maximum coverage probability for each BS density. Numerically solvable expressions are derived for such optimal antenna downtilt, which is a function of the BS density. Our numerical results show that after applying the optimal antenna downtilt, the network performance can be significantly improved, and hence the ASE crash can be delayed by nearly one order of magnitude in terms of the BS density. Our results also give guidance on setting the optimum downtilt angle to maximize network performance given a fixed BS density.},

The existed popular anti-collision algorithms are ALOHA-type algorithms and QT. But these methods show good performance when the number of tags to read is small and not dynamic. However, when the number of tags to read is large and dynamic, the efficiency of recognition is very low. A novel approach to mapped correlation of ID for RFID anti-collision has been proposed to solve the problem in this paper. This method can increase the association between tags so that tags can send their own ID under certain trigger conditions, by mapped correlation of ID, querying on multi-tree becomes more efficient. In the case of not too big number of tags, by replacing the actual ID with the temporary ID, the method can greatly reduce the number of times that the reader reads and writes to tag's ID. In the case of dynamic ALOHA-type applications, the reader can determine the locations of the empty slots according to the position of the binary pulse, so it can avoid the decrease in efficiency which is caused by reading empty slots when reading slots. Experiments have shown this method can greatly improve the recognition efficiency of the system.},

	abstract = {In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) of mobile education (such as mobile learning), in order to keep a better and lower energy consumption, reduce the energy hole and prolong the network life cycle, we propose a novel unequal clustering routing protocol considering energy balancing based on network partition \& distance (UCNPD, which means Unequal Clustering based on Network Partition \& Distance) for WSN in this paper. In the design model of this protocol, we know that all the network node data reaches the base station (BS) through the nodes near the BS, and the nodes in this area will use more energy, so we define a ring area using the BS as the center to form a circle, then we partition the network area based on the distance from node to the BS. These parts of nodes are to build connection with the BS, and the others follow the optimized clustering routing service protocol which uses a timing mechanism to elect the cluster head. It reduces the energy consumption of cluster reconstruction. Furthermore, we build unequal clusters by setting different competitive radius, which is helpful for balancing the network energy consumption. For the selection of message route, we considered all the energy of cluster head, the distances to BS and the degrees of node to reduce and balance the energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the protocol can efficiently decrease the speed of the nodes death, prolong the network lifetime, and balance the energy dissipation of all nodes.},

Due to the limited energy and communication ability of sensor nodes, it seems especially important to design a routing protocol for WSNs so that sensing data can be transmitted to the receiver effectively. An energy-balanced routing method based on forward-aware factor (FAF-EBRM) is proposed in this paper. In FAF-EBRM, the next-hop node is selected according to the awareness of link weight and forward energy density. Furthermore, a spontaneous reconstruction mechanism for local topology is designed additionally. In the experiments, FAF-EBRM is compared with LEACH and EEUC, experimental results show that FAF-EBRM outperforms LEACH and EEUC, which balances the energy consumption, prolongs the function lifetime and guarantees high QoS of WSN.},

On how to select cluster head, a new energy-efficient clustering method based on degree, relative distance and residual energy of nodes is designed, which guarantees that distribution of cluster heads is uniform, scale of clusters is balanced, and nodes with high energy act as cluster head preferentially. By using swarm colony optimization idea, we design PEECR strategy for data transferring. A predictive data transferring strategy between clusters is designed. Taking expected energy consumption on a road, hops and propagation delay into account, definition of good ratio of a road is given, according to which we choose optimal road. In reception mode, energy consumption of transceivers from source node to sink node of wireless sensor network is similar to energy consumption from sink node to source node, and both can be minimized by our approach. Our experimental tests show that novel optimized clustering routing approach can improve quality of clusters and whole performance of network, reduce and balance energy consumption of the whole network, and prolong lifetime of WSN as well.},

The proposal of compressive sensing technology provides a novel way for data aggregation in WSN. Based on the clustering structure of WSN, a kind of effective data aggregating method based on compressive sensing is proposed in this paper. The aggregating process is divided into two parts: in the cluster, the sink node sets the corresponding seed vector based on the distribution of network and then sends it to each cluster head. Cluster head can generate corresponding own random spacing sparse matrix based on its received seed vector and collect data through compressive sensing technology. Among clusters, clusters forward measurement values to the sink node along multi-hop routing tree. Performance analysis and comparison with the relative methods show that our method is effective and superior to other methods regardless of intra-cluster or inter-cluster on the total energy consumption of network.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is utilized in various application domains, such as data mining, pattern recognition, machine learning, etc. UFS follows three basic approaches, namely filter, wrapper, and hybrid (that is, a combination of both filter and wrapper) to select the relevant and non-redundant features. It has been observed that a filter method does not guarantee an optimal solution. However, a wrapper approach is computationally expensive. The hybrid method are known to give a better trade-off between filter and wrapper strategies. But, the practical applicability of schemes mentioned above are preferably restricted only to a numerical dataset and are not so suitable for a mixed dataset. Therefore, there is a need for a UFS scheme which can handle both the numerical and non-numerical features directly. In this paper, a robust and efficient two-phase (i.e., feature ranking (FR) and feature selection (FS)) UFS method is proposed. The proposed FR utilizes entropy and mutual information to produce maximum informative and non-redundant ranked features from a high-dimensional mixed dataset. Further, the proposed FS follows k-prototype clustering algorithm with improved Callinski-Harasbaz criteria-based selection methodology to choose optimal features. Experiments on real-life dataset substantiate that the proposed approach provides a better subset of features compared to the existing state of the art approaches.},

	abstract = {We aimed to explore how different social isolation components were associated with depression among older adults in Portugal. We analysed data collected through structured questionnaires in 2017 from 643 Portuguese adults aged 60 and over. Depression was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (Short-Form). Social isolation was operationalised using objective indicators – living alone, marital status, leisure activities – and subjective indicator – perceived social support. Because social isolation is a multidimensional construct that is likely to be more than the sum of its components, cluster analysis was conducted to group individuals into social isolation profiles. Associations were estimated using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Five profiles were identified: Cluster 1 (partnered; high social support; high variety of leisure activities); Cluster 2 (partnered; high social support; few leisure activities); Cluster 3 (not partnered; low social support; few leisure activities); Cluster 4 (living alone; high social support; high variety of leisure activities); Cluster 5 (partnered; high social support; limited variety of leisure activities). Compared with Cluster 1, participants in Cluster 2 were three times more likely to have depression, independent of age, gender, education, comorbidities and self-rated health (OR = 3.04; 95\% CI: 1.38–6.71). Participants in Cluster 3 presented the highest probability of depression that was not explained by any of the confounders (OR = 4.74; 95\% CI: 2.15–10.44). Older adults living alone are not necessarily more prone to depression, with social support and leisure activities playing an important role. To disentangle how social isolation affects health, objective and subjective isolation measures should be considered.},

To address this knowledge-gap we apply a divide-and-conquer approach which separates viral, mammalian and network features into three unique perspectives, each predicting associations independently to enhance predictive power. Our approach predicts over 20,000 unknown associations between known viruses and susceptible mammalian species, suggesting that current knowledge underestimates the number of associations in wild and semi-domesticated mammals by a factor of 4.3, and the average potential mammalian host-range of viruses by a factor of 3.2. In particular, our results highlight a significant knowledge gap in the wild reservoirs of important zoonotic and domesticated mammals’ viruses: specifically, lyssaviruses, bornaviruses and rotaviruses.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal variation in community composition is of considerable interest in ecology. However, few studies have focused on seasonal variation patterns in taxonomic and functional community composition at the fine scale. As such, we conducted seasonal high-density sampling of the submerged macrophyte community in Hongshan Bay of Erhai Lake in China and used the generalized dissimilarity model (GDM) to evaluate the effects of environmental factors and geographic distance on taxonomic and functional beta diversity as well as corresponding turnover and nestedness components. At the fine scale, taxonomic turnover and nestedness as well as functional turnover and nestedness showed comparable contributions to corresponding taxonomic and functional beta diversity, with different importance across seasons. All taxonomic and functional dissimilarity metrics showed seasonal variation. Of note, taxonomic beta diversity was highest in summer and lowest in winter, while functional beta diversity showed the opposite pattern. Taxonomic and functional turnover showed similar change patterns as taxonomic and functional beta diversity. Taxonomic nestedness was low in summer and high in winter. Functional nestedness was also lower in summer. These results suggest that under extreme environmental conditions, both turnover and nestedness can exist at the fine scale and seasonal community composition patterns in submerged macrophytes should be considered. Future investigations on community assembly mechanisms should pay greater attention to long-term dynamic characteristics and functional information.},

The aim of this study was to examine wild populations of C. cardunculus established in Portugal, in order to determine their genetic diversity, geographic distribution, and population structure. Based on SSR markers, 121 individuals of C. cardunculus from 17 wild populations of the Portuguese Alentejo region were identified and analysed. Ten SSRs were found to be efficient markers in the genetic diversity analysis. The total number of alleles ranged from 9 to 17 per locus. The expected and observed means in heterozygosity, by population analysed, were 0.591 and 0.577, respectively. The wild population exhibited a high level of genetic diversity at the species level. The highest proportion of genetic variation was identified within a geographic group, while variation was lower among groups. Geographic areas having highest genetic diversity were identified in Alvito, Herdade da Abóboda, Herdade da Revilheira and Herdade de São Romão populations. Moreover, significant genetic differentiation existed between wild populations from North-Alentejo geographic locations (Arraiolos, Évora, Monte da Chaminé) and Centro Hortofrutícola, compared with other populations. This study reports genetic diversity among a representative number of wild populations and genotypes of C. cardunculus from Portugal.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the failure of grid systems to provide electricity access to last mile users has led to the rapid scale up of off-grid solutions. The authors examine synergies and tradeoffs between solar off-grid solutions and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Rwanda which as a nation has successfully implemented innovative solar off-grid systems at scale. This paper is the first to map the relationship between energy and the 169 Targets of the 2030 Agenda in a specific country and sector context by operationalising the framework developed in Fuso Nerini et al.

The paper identifies synergies between 80 (47\%) of the SDG targets and off-grid solar systems in Rwanda, thus demonstrating the wideranging benefits and value added through the inclusion of the off-grid solar energy sector in the electrification strategy. The paper demonstrates how mainstreaming off-grid policies and prioritising investment in the off-grid sector can realise human development and well-being, build physical and social infrastructures, and achieve sustainable management of environmental resources.},

Following this, this study talks about designing an SDG framework for India, which can be used as a benchmark for other Asian countries. In this pursuit, this study looks into whether per capita income, energy use, trade openness, and oil price have any impact on CO2 emissions between 1980 and 2019. The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag approach proves that the fluctuations in independent variables have an asymmetric long-term impact on CO2 emissions. The results reveal that the prevailing economic growth pattern in India is environmentally unsustainable, because of its dependence on fossil fuel-based energy consumption and imported crude oil. Import substitution has been identified as one of the first stepping stones to address this issue, and accordingly, a multipronged SDG framework has been designed based on the direct and extended version of the study outcomes.

	abstract = {Achieving the targets set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) will require committed efforts by nations and organizations over the coming decade. To determine which actions work most harmoniously within funding, infrastructure development, and implementation of three closely aligned goals, we conducted an assessment to identify where the greatest synergies may occur and where conflicting resource needs create trade-offs that may threaten SDG success. The SDGs each have several targets that need to be realized for the goal to be reached. In the present study, we developed a methodology where each target of the SDG 2 (food), 6 (water) and 7 (energy) was analyzed for its input requirements, infrastructure needs, and the risks and benefits for the provision of ecosystem services. Then the targets were compared pairwise and a total score of interaction was calculated to determine different levels of synergies and trade-offs for every pair. In some cases targets were mutually supportive, in other cases there were no interactions among the targets, and for some areas the targets were in conflict with each other. For example, targets 2.5, 6.5 and 7.a have no conflicts with other targets and have different levels of synergies with most of the other targets. On the contrary, various targets of SDG 2, and especially the target 2.b, are in slight conflict with other targets by potentially overusing resources needed by other targets or threatening ecosystem services. Our approach confirms the general belief that SDG 6 (water) has the highest number of potential synergies (a total of 124). Thus, achieving the water targets will make it continuously easier to achieve other targets. While the results may need to be adapted for a specific locality or country, overall they provide an improved understanding of the interactions between the targets. The value of the study lies in the quantitative methodology as it can be used as a replicable analysis for any level of work on SDG implementation.},

Lung function values FEV1, FVC and the FEV1/FVC ratio, were measured with ndd EasyOneR spirometer. Airflow limitation was determined with FEV1/FVC Z-score values at −1.64 as the lower limit of normal (LLN5). The Global Lung Function Initiative 2012 software was used to calculate the lung function indices.ResultsThe median age (range) of the 912 children enrolled was 10.6 years (6–18). Altogether, 468 (51.6\%) children lived in rural areas. Seven hundred and thirty-seven (80.7\%) were directly exposed to cooking fuels (418/737, 56.5\% in rural areas). Wood and kerosene were the dominant fuels in rural and urban households. The respective mean Z-scores of the exposed children in rural and urban were zFEV1 −0.62, FVC −0.21, FEV1/FVC −0.83 and zFEV1 −0.57, zFVC −0.14, FEV1/FVC −0.75. Few (5.2\%, 38/737) of the children had airflow limitation. Most of them (60.5\%, 25/38) lived in the rural community; the lowest FEV1/FVC Z-scores were those of exposed to a combination of fuels.ConclusionExposure to cooking fuels affects lung function in children with airway limitation in a small proportion, Control measures are advocated to reduce the morbidity related to cooking fuels exposure.},

This study investigated the association between household use of biomass fuels for cooking and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in preschool age children (\&lt;5 years) in Zimbabwe.Methods Analysis is based on 3559 children age 0–59 months included in the 1999 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS). Children who suffered from cough accompanied by short, rapid breathing during the 2 weeks preceding the survey were defined as having suffered from ARI. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of suffering from ARI among children from households using biomass fuels (wood, dung, or straw) relative to children from households using cleaner fuels (liquid petroleum gas [LPG]/natural gas, or electricity), after controlling for potentially confounding factors.Results About two-thirds (66\%) of children lived in households using biomass fuels and 16\% suffered from ARI during the 2 weeks preceding the survey interview. After adjusting for child’s age, sex, birth order, nutritional status, mother’s age at childbirth, education, religion, household living standard, and region of residence, children in households using wood, dung, or straw for cooking were more than twice as likely to have suffered from ARI as children from households using LPG/natural gas or electricity (OR = 2.20; 95\% CI: 1.16, 4.19).Conclusions Household use of high pollution biomass fuels is associated with ARI in children in Zimbabwe. The relationship needs to be further investigated using more direct measures of smoke exposure and clinical measures of ARI.},

	abstract = {One half of the world's population relies on biomass fuel as the primary source of domestic energy. Biomass fuel exposure causes a high degree of morbidity and mortality in humans. This is especially true in the context of developing countries, which account for 99\% of the world's biomass fuel use. Biomass fuel consists of fire wood, dung cakes, agricultural crop residues such as straw, grass, and shrubs, coal fuels and kerosene. Together, they supply 75\% of the domestic energy in India. An estimated three-quarters of Indian households use biomass fuel as the primary means for domestic cooking. Ninety percent of rural households and 32\% of urban households cook their meals on a biomass stove. There are wide variations between the rural and urban households regarding the specific type of biomass fuel used. Globally, almost 2 million deaths per year are attributable to solid fuel use, with more than 99\% of these occurring in developing countries. Biomass fuel accounts for 5-6\% of the national burden of disease. Burning biomass fuels emits toxic fumes into the air that consist of small solid particles, carbon monoxide, polyorganic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and formaldehyde. Exposure to biomass fuels has been found to be associated with many respiratory diseases such as acute lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, and asthma. Biomass fuel exposure is closely related to the burden of disease in India. Hopes are that future studies will examine the morbidity associated with biomass exposure and seek to prevent it. Concerted efforts to improve stove design and transition to high-efficiency low-emission fuels may reduce respiratory disease associated with biomass fuel exposure.},

Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is one of the major causes of childhood morbidity which leads to mortality as well.
Aim
The study aimed to estimate the effect of household cooking fuels and smoking habits on the prevalence of ARI among under-five children over India.
Methods
This study employs nationally representative data National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4: 2015–2016) which was gathered and arranged by International Institute for Population Science, Mumbai as the Nodal Agency under the patronage of the Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Government of India. The χ2 test implemented to assess the difference by the prevalence of ARI against the use of household cooking fuels, smoking habits and socio-demographic characteristics. Then binary logistic regression models were incorporated to look at the crude and net impact of cooking fuels used in households on childhood ARI.
Result \& Findings
ARI was mostly affective for those children who were from those households where biomasses were the main source of cooking fuels and significantly the prevalence of ARI was related to the combustion of biomass fuels for cooking (p {\textless} 0.0005). The smoking habits (OR = 1.42, CI: 1.18–1.70) and use of biomass cooking fuels (OR = 1.03, CI: 0.86–1.08) significantly predicted the higher probability of ARI prevalence among children. Therefore children should be kept away from the kitchen during cooking and the kitchen room should have sufficient open space to evacuate the pollutants easily.},

The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) estimates the prevalence of current wheeze among children in Nigeria to have risen from 10.7\% in 1999 to approximately 20\% in 2014. Objective: To examine the effects of biomass smoke exposure on asthma symptom prevalence in rural children in Nigeria. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in rural communities in Nigeria. Asthma symptoms were defined according to ISAAC definitions. Biomass smoke exposure was determined by the types of fuel used for cooking. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between biomass smoke and asthma symptoms. Results: The study population comprised 1,690 school children, of which 865 lived in households cooking with biomass and 825 lived in households not using biomass. Asthma symptoms were reported in 481 (28.5\%) children. Biomass fuel was associated with increased odds of asthma symptoms. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were 1.38 (95\% CI: 1.05–1.80) for nocturnal cough, 1.26 (95\% CI: 1.00–1.61) for current wheeze, and 1.33 (95\% CI: 1.05–1.69) for report of any asthma-related symptoms. Sex modified the associations between asthma symptoms with biomass fuel: aORs were stronger and significant for males (nocturnal cough = 1.85, 95\% CI: 1.24–2.76; current wheeze = 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.03–2.13; report of any asthma-related symptoms = 1.60, 95\% CI: 1.12–2.28), but weaker and non-significant for females.Conclusion: The risk of asthma symptoms related to biomass smoke exposure appears to differ by sex.},

This effectiveness stems from its closeness to practice-based/situated expertise and real-life problem contexts. This article presents and tests one approach within transdisciplinary research, which specifically focuses on increasing the participation of actors from outside of academic in knowledge production processes, called transdisciplinary (TD) co-production. The framework for TD co-production focused on five focal areas (inclusion, collaboration, integration, usability, and reflexivity) in three research phases (Formulate, Generate, Evaluate). This paper tests and evaluates the use of this framework in five research projects. The results discuss how the focal areas and research phases dealt with many crucial issues in transdisciplinary knowledge production. They stimulated a high level of stakeholder participation and commitment to the research processes, and promoted knowledge integration and reflexive learning across diverse sectors and disciplines. The approach, however, came up against a number of practical barriers stemming primarily from institutional, organizational and cognitive differences of the participating organizations. While TD co-production increased the usability of the results in terms of their relevance and accessibility, it paradoxically did not ensure their anchoring in respective institutional and political contexts where societal change occurs.},

In 2016, only 16.9\% of rural and 65.3\% of urban inhabitants in mainland Tanzania were connected to some form of electricity. We use a nationally representative three-wave panel dataset (2008–2013) to contribute to the literature on household energy use decisions in Tanzania in the context of the stacking and energy ladder hypotheses. We firstly adopt a panel multinomial-logit approach to model the determinants of household cooking- and lighting-fuel choices, using night time lights data to proxy for electricity access. Secondly, we focus explicitly on energy stacking behaviour, proposing various ways of measuring what is inferred when stacking behaviour is thought of in the context of the energy transition and presenting household level correlates of energy stacking behaviour. Thirdly, since fuel uses have gender-differentiated impacts, we investigate the relevance of common proxies of women’s intra-household bargaining power in the decision-making process of household fuel choices. We find that whilst higher household incomes are strongly associated with a transition towards the adoption of more modern fuels, especially for lighting, this transition takes place in a context of significant fuel stacking. In Tanzania, government policy has been aimed mostly at connecting households to the electricity grid. However, the public health, environmental and social benefits of access to modern energy sources are likely to be diminished in a context of significant fuel stacking. Our analysis using proxies of women’s intra-household bargaining power suggests that the level of education of the spouse is also a major factor in the transition towards the use of modern fuels.},

	abstract = {The pervasiveness of \&ldquo;stacking\&rdquo; between traditional and clean fuels/stoves is moving the household clean cooking research and policy agenda from programs that are centered on one-fuel or stove, to multi-clean fuel/device interventions that could result in a more effective displacement of traditional biomass stoves. However, there is little recognition and knowledge of the benefits realistic clean-stacking cooking solutions can have on indoor air quality and health. In this paper, particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentration levels that are associated with stove-stacking options (Patsari-U-shaped open fire (U-type), Patsari-liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stove, U-type-LPG, and Patsari-U-type-LPG) common within rural Mexico were evaluated while using a controlled cooking cycle (CCC) from the Purepecha Highlands, which mimics the most common dishes prepared daily within the region as well as their sequential arrangement. The results confirms that the WHO Interim Target-1 (IT1) of 35 \&mu;g/m3 for PM2.5 is exceeded whenever woodburning open fires are part of the stacking combination (Patsari-U-type 107 \&plusmn; 9 \&mu;g/m3, U-type-LPG 131 \&plusmn; 55 \&mu;g/m3 and Patsari-U-type-LPG 107 \&plusmn; 22 \&mu;g/m3). However, well-designed and properly operated woodburning chimney stoves, such as the Patsari can meet the IT1, either used exclusively (21 \&plusmn; 8 \&mu;g/m3) or as a \&ldquo;clean stacking\&rdquo; option with LPG (24 \&plusmn; 5 \&mu;g/m3). Given stove stacking patterns, evaluating the health and environmental consequences of stove transitions while assuming the total replacement of traditional fires by clean cooking options will lead to misplaced expectations, and programs should evaluate more realistic \&ldquo;clean-stacking\&rdquo; options.},

	abstract = {Drawing on qualitative data from three contrasting sites in Benue state, Nigeria, this paper explores how and why cooking system use and priorities vary over time and space as well as the influence of household air pollution (HAP)-related health risks on fuel and stove choices. The findings indicated that cooking system choices were constrained by economic and access considerations linked to spatio-temporal variations in fuel cost, availability and service quality coupled with socio-cultural and utilitarian influences on cooking practices. Respondents demonstrated strong preferences for wood-fuelled traditional stoves although shifts in fuel use between wet and dry seasons were observed. Stove and fuel ‘stacking’ were widely practised to meet different cooking requirements and minimise risks from (often seasonal) variations in fuel prices, access and reliability of supply. ‘Backsliding’ from clean to solid biomass fuels was observed when families outgrew their improved cookstoves or considered biomass to be more affordable, reliable, accessible or safer. There was limited awareness or concern about HAP-related health risks and smoke was valued for preserving food and signalling food security. Attention is drawn to the value of integrating household risk perceptions into improved cookstove promotion and behaviour change initiatives to better understand constraints to the adoption and sustained use of clean cooking systems. The paper concludes by highlighting the benefits of monitoring household cooking system stacks (rather than the ‘main’ fuel/stove used) for analysing how their components vary over space and time and providing insights into the effectiveness of measures taken to reduce HAP exposure.},

	abstract = {Stove stacking (concurrent use of multiple stoves and/or fuels) is a poorly quantified practice in regions with ongoing efforts to transition household energy to cleaner options. Using biomass-burning stoves alongside clean stoves undermines health and environmental goals. This review synthesizes stove stacking data gathered from eleven case studies of clean cooking programs in low- and middle-income country settings. Analyzed data are from ministry and program records, research studies, and informant interviews. Thematic analysis identifiedy key drivers of stove stacking behavior in each setting. Significant (28\%–100\%) stacking with traditional cooking methods was observed in all cases. Reasons for traditional fuel use included: costs of clean fuel; mismatches between cooking technologies and household needs; and unreliable fuel supply. National household surveys often focus on 'primary' cookstoves and miss stove stacking data. Thus more attention should be paid to discontinuation of traditional stove use, not solely adoption of cleaner stoves/fuels. Future energy policies and programs should acknowledge the realities of stacking and incorporate strategies at the design stage to transition away from polluting stoves/fuels. Seven principles for clean cooking program design and policy are presented, focused on a shift toward "cleaner stacking" that could yield household air pollution reductions approaching WHO targets.},

	abstract = {Interest in household energy use and improved cookstoves is growing again, prompted this time by a breadth of concerns that range from local environmental, socio-cultural and, very particularly, health issues to global aspects related to the emissions of greenhouse gases. To face these challenges, improved cookstove programs are evolving from projects narrowly targeting stove construction or sales to more integrated “systemic” approaches. This paper discusses one such approach: a multi-institutional effort directed to improve the sustainability of household energy use in rural Mexico. The program is based in the highlands of central Mexico, and seeks to set up a model that can be scaled up and replicated in other regions. The program has five main components that are highly integrated: technology innovation and market development, a cookstove dissemination package, support to micro-enterprise development, monitoring and evaluation and outreach activities. One of the program's salient features is the development and dissemination of a new efficient wood-burning cookstove named “Patsari”. Results of the first year and a half of project implementation and the main challenges and lessons learned by the program are presented and discussed.},

However, attempts to combine qualitative and quantitative methods are rare and there are a lack of systematic approaches to this. This paper demonstrates a two stage approach using clustering methods to analyse a mixed dataset containing quantitative household survey data and qualitative interview data. By clustering the quantitative and qualitative data separately, latent groups with common characteristics and narratives arising from each of the two analyses are identified. A second stage of clustering identifies links between these qualitative and quantitative clusters and enables inference of energy transition pathways followed by low-income urban households defined by both quantitative characteristics and qualitative narratives. This approach can support interdisciplinary collaboration in energy research, providing a systematic approach to comparing and identifying links between quantitative and qualitative findings.•A mixed dataset comprising of quantitative survey data and qualitative interview data on low-income household energy use is analysed using hierarchical clustering to detect communities within each dataset.•Interviewees are matched to quantitative survey clusters and a second stage of clustering is performed using cluster membership as variables.•Second stage clusters identify common pairs of survey and interview clusters which define energy transition pathways based on socio-economic characteristics, energy use patterns, and narratives for decision making and practices.},

While emerging data ethics curriculum is supporting data science students in identifying data biases and their consequences, critical attention to the cultural histories and vested interests animating data semantics is needed to elucidate the assumptions and political commitments on which data rest, along with the externalities they produce. In this article, I introduce three modes of reading that can be engaged when studying datasets—a denotative reading (extrapolating the literal meaning of values in a dataset), a connotative reading (tracing the socio-political provenance of data semantics), and a deconstructive reading (seeking what gets Othered through data semantics and structure). I then outline how I have taught students to engage these methods when analyzing three datasets in Data and Society—a course designed to cultivate student competency in politically aware data analysis and interpretation. I show how combined, the reading strategies prompt students to grapple with the double binds of perceiving contemporary problems through systems of representation that are always situated, incomplete, and inflected with diverse politics. While I introduce these methods in the context of teaching, I argue that the methods are integral to any data practice in the conclusion.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The city can be viewed from many perspectives. In this article the author's perspective will be the city as knowledge tool. In the knowledge economy it might be argued that one of the most essential dimensions will be the relational as well as organizational dimensions, such as a city. The city is the larger context, or structural capital surrounding the human capital, for the value creation dynamics. This also implies that the city is a very complex issue but also highly dynamic knowledge context. Design/methodology/approach – The method is literature review, empirical project case observations and creative research. Findings – The city might be seen in this context of a more or less good city regime to support the value creation from and for the knowledge workers. Then the distinction can be that a knowledge city is purposely designed for encouraging and nourishing the collective knowledge, i.e. intellectual capital, as capabilities to shape efficient and sustainable actions of welfare over time. The city can be seen as the structural capital surrounding the human capital but also the relational capital connecting the human capital with the structural capital to give a higher value adding for the knowledge worker. Practical implications – The city design is the critical organizational and relational capital of tomorrow for the knowledge worker. The city concept and design of its new urbanism, i.e. people migrating into cities, is becoming more and more of a strategic tool in the global competition of knowledge or talent war. To shape the efficient interface for the individual knowledge worker to leverage the global opportunity space with a local opportunity space. In the case of urban design for the knowledge economy this might take us to the need for designing a knowledge port for the knowledge flow as an exchange design for the intangible flows. Originality/value – This paper views the larger structural capital surrounding the knowledge worker by both looking at some cases as well as stating a preliminary model of drivers for design of a knowledge city. These mentioned cases or forecasts might have strong impact on the urban design for attracting and nourishing citizens for the growth of social capital as network of friends into a new type of urbanism for minds. The knowledge city design is a unifying concept that will help to integrate perspectives of economics, urban studies and knowledge management. The design of a knowledge harbor concept is a multidisciplinary issue and is now being prototyped in reality.},

	abstract = {Sustainable use and supply of natural resources dedicated to feeding urban life are becoming increasingly complex in a time of rapid urbanization and climate change. Sustainable governance of Water–Energy–Food (WEF) requires innovative and cross-sectorial systems of provisioning. However, practitioners have often treated WEF as separate domains, while ignoring their interconnectedness. What is missing is an ‘Urban Nexus’ perspective, which assumes that environmental flows of WEF interact and relate to one another in achieving urban sustainable development. This paper contributes to theorizing the urban nexus and to understand its emergence and governance from a more socio-material perspective. It offers a conceptual framework that helps to shed light on the social and material flows shaping connections between the sectors of WEF, and the actors facilitating these connections. The paper suggests that switchers and programmers link and configure the socio-material flows of WEF facilitating the emergence of nexus governance networks and nexus programs. In doing so, the paper provides three examples of cities to test the conceptual framework by analyzing their main challenges and examples around the nexus. It demonstrates that material and social dimensions of WEF might not play an equal role in steering synergies or trade-offs—either material or social flows and their agents can be central in facilitating a nexus or in preventing it to take shape. The paper argues that material-focused methodologies need to be complemented with a social flows analysis that pays attention to the daily practice, policies, ideologies, networks or any kind of socio-cultural meaning shaping WEF provisioning.},

I discuss a model of entry thresholds in which market size is a function of both population and geographic space and evaluate implications of this model with a new data set of 127,000 restaurants across 726 cities. I find that geographic concentration of a population leads to a greater number of cuisines and the likelihood of having a specific cuisine is increasing in population and population density, with the rarest cuisines found only in the biggest, densest cities. Further, there is a strong hierarchical pattern to the distribution of variety across cities in which the specific cuisines available can be predicted by the total count. These findings parallel empirical work on Central Place Theory and provide evidence that demand aggregation has a significant impact on consumer product variety.},

Food shapes cities and through them it moulds us - along with the countryside that feeds us. Yet few of us are conscious of the process and we rarely stop to wonder how food reaches our plates. Hungry City examines the way in which modern food production has damaged the balance of human existence, and reveals that we have yet to resolve a centuries-old dilemma - one which holds the key to a host of current problems, from obesity and the inexorable rise of the supermarkets, to the destruction of the natural world.Original, inspiring and written with infectious enthusiasm and belief, Hungry City illuminates an issue that is fundamental to us all.},

	abstract = {Background
Lack of access to healthy foods may explain why residents of low-income neighborhoods and African Americans in the U.S. have high rates of obesity. The findings on where people shop and how that may influence health are mixed. However, multiple policy initiatives are underway to increase access in communities that currently lack healthy options. Few studies have simultaneously measured obesity, distance, and prices of the store used for primary food shopping.
Purpose
To examine the relationship among distance to store, food prices, and obesity.
Methods
The Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Research on Eating, Shopping, and Health study conducted baseline interviews with 1,372 households between May and December 2011 in two low-income, majority African American neighborhoods without a supermarket. Audits of 16 stores where participants reported doing their major food shopping were conducted. Data were analyzed between February 2012 and February 2013.
Results
Distance to store and prices were positively associated with obesity (p{\textless}0.05). When distance to store and food prices were jointly modeled, only prices remained significant (p{\textless}0.01), with higher prices predicting a lower likelihood of obesity. Although low- and high-price stores did not differ in availability, they significantly differed in their display and marketing of junk foods relative to healthy foods.
Conclusions
Placing supermarkets in food deserts to improve access may not be as important as simultaneously offering better prices for healthy foods relative to junk foods, actively marketing healthy foods, and enabling consumers to resist the influence of junk food marketing.},

	abstract = {Freight transportation has received limited attention in the past compared to passenger transportation, especially in developing economies. However, the importance of freight transportation for the efficient functioning of any urban transportation system is gradually being realized. Estimating freight trips generated by the various manufacturing and service sectors in an urban setup is the primary step in freight transportation and management. For this purpose, segregating the various sectors and estimating freight trip generation is imperative. The primary aim of this study is to develop freight trip generation equations for one of the booming sectors in India, the restaurant service sector. The regions of Mumbai and Delhi-NCR are the focus of this study. About 150 restaurants (101 in Delhi-NCR, and 49 in Mumbai) were surveyed for this study. The face-to-face interview method at the establishments was adopted as the primary mode of data collection, primarily due to its high response rate. The daily average freight trips produced and attracted are observed to be approximately three vehicles and six vehicles, respectively. Separate models are estimated for freight trip attraction and production. It is observed that Poisson regression models for both attraction and production outperform the respective linear regression models. Poisson regression models are particularly useful when the dependent variable values are non-negative integers with sparse dispersion and a low mean. As far as the influencing variables are concerned, employment, vehicle ownership, and seating capacity are found to be significant for the freight trip models. The interaction variable formed by employment and vehicle ownership is used in the trip attraction model; similarly, a variable is created form the interaction of seating capacity and vehicle ownership in the trip production models.},

On the one hand, it is an important source of income, employment and waste; on the other hand, it provides many opportunities for eating out and social interaction. For a given city, where does the catering sector concentrate the most and how far are people, on average, from this location across hours of a day? Are people, on average, closer to the concentration around the prime dinner time? Taking advantage of open and big data, we geovisualised the answers in the context of Beijing, the capital of China, with a population of 22+ million people. Specifically, the data we used were the 2015 points of interest of Baidu Map (the Chinese counterpart of Google Maps) and 10–16 August 2015 cellular network data for Beijing. The former provide us with the number and location of most if not all restaurants around the local metro-served area (MSA) – that is, areas that are within an 800-metre radius of a metro station. The latter allow us to derive the average number of cellular phone users (as a proxy for the general population, residents and/or employees) by MSA across hours of a day. We depict the top five population/employment/residential centres (quantified by the average number of cellular phone users) at three different times of the day, and the top 10 food centres (measured by the number of restaurants) at the MSA level in Beijing.},

Empirical evidence revealed that the probability of commercial gentrification increases as the travel distance from metro stations decreases. In addition, the influence ranges of commercial gentrification are approximately 240 m for short-term changes (2009–2012) and 300 m for long-term changes (2009–2015). The influence ranges also vary with the land uses of the station areas. Accordingly, this research suggests that local administrations should take commercial gentrification into account when developing metro systems.},

This survey found that 80\% of the sampled households could be classified as moderately or severely food insecure. In urban areas the main driver of food insecurity is not availability but access. Access is typically viewed as being directly related to income. Households were found to use formal food markets, but more frequently depended on informal sector markets and informal social safety nets. The more food insecure and income poor a household was, the more likely it was to be dependent on less formal means of securing food. This suggests that there is some form of market failure in the formal food system. This paper therefore advocates for a food systems approach that validates and supports the role that the informal sector plays in urban food security.},

Although researchers broadly agree on the importance of incorporating the concept of the food, energy, and water nexus into policy strategies and decision-making, the assessment system for how governance methods can improve the provision of these three essential services is relatively blank. To clarify the policy mechanisms and heterogeneity of sustainability issues related to the food, energy and water nexus at the city level, this study develops an indicator system to guide the implementations and optimize urban sustainability. A qualitative approach is employed to form the priority strategies in in four selected cities: Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Taipei, and Tainan. The results show that renewable energy plays an essential role in the food-energy-water nexus. In addition, we also observed that future work should focus on technological innovation. These observations imply that the unique combination of influence factors in food-energy-water sustainability offers a comprehensive outlook of the broad and complex challenges that a city faces due to resource limitations, which can help inform future governance practices. Finally, some policy recommendations are made for highlighting and the activities needed to work. The results of the present evaluation could be used as a tool to strengthen food-energy-water management in the future. They can guide managers to develop possible solutions that ensure resources are applied successfully according to the visions of multiple perspectives and help the relevant ministries to improve future consultation plans.},

People choose particular sites and routes, and they make wider decisions based on digital map content. The article highlights the senses of security people gain from using digital maps, and the influence that their use has, for instance, on choices of which home to buy (landed capital acquisition), which route to take and by which mode of transport, and which restaurant or hotel to visit. As such, the article argues that digital maps influence the ways in which bodies are distributed and move in urban space. The article applies a practice theory lens to data from a scoping sample survey (n = 261), 32 semi-structured interviews, and three focus groups. Through empirical examples, it demonstrates how a sense of security provided by digital maps is experienced by users, and how that serves to influence the decisions people make in negotiating and making urban space meaningful.},

	abstract = {The impact of different places on women’s practices has not been much explored in the context of informal settlements in Iran, where they face many restrictions due to socio-cultural norms. Using a qualitative approach, this paper investigates how different geographies of place affect women’s practices for social interaction and physical activity. This research is based on primary data collection through interviews and transect walks in Moradab Hill, which is an informal settlement in Iran. The research shows that unlike the studies that emphasise the benefit of parks, in this case women’s social life flourished on streets and in private and semi-private everyday places such as shops, areas around houses, and workplaces. The results show a considerable difference in the impact of different urban fabrics on women’s practices. Fine urban grain with small accessible shops increased women's perception of safety and visibility on streets. It allowed practices of social greetings and mobility. Self-built single-family houses encouraged outdoor social practices with neighbours. Conversely, those women who were moved to high-rise buildings in the same area as part of the neighbourhood regeneration found themselves restricted by high-rise typology and felt unsafe or uncomfortable going outside or to the parks. Parks that are proposed as a part of the regeneration plans are primarily appropriated by men whereas women are dependent on private and semi-private spaces as social infrastructure, with high-rise typology being a threat to personal mobility under the current socio-cultural norms.},

	abstract = {In this work, we consider facility location decisions for street markets in food desert zones. Street markets operate on certain days of the week in public and open spaces such as local parks or city squares. The implementation of street markets is a decision that involves local governments with limited budget. Therefore, it is crucial to optimize the budget usage while satisfying as much demand as possible and maximizing coverage. In this work, we propose a mathematical model that determines the number, locations, and schedules of street markets considering customers’ georeferentiation and its probability of choosing street markets over competitors such as local small retailers. Our model, which is a variant of the facility location problem, integrates different tools such as clustering methods and discrete choice. We conducted computational experiments using information from Valparaíso Chile region. Results show the effectivity of our proposal when locating street markets in food desert zones. The model produces (1) optimal locations of street markets, (2) street markets schedule, (3) quantities to allocate in each street market, and (4) the required budget to be allocated in street market policies.},

	abstract = {Objectives. We explored new ways to identify food deserts.

Methods. We estimated physical and economic access to supermarkets for 5 low-income groups in Seattle–King County, Washington. We used geographic information system data to measure physical access: service areas around each supermarket were delineated by ability to walk, bicycle, ride transit, or drive within 10 minutes. We assessed economic access by stratifying supermarkets into low, medium, and high cost. Combining income and access criteria generated multiple ways to estimate food deserts.

Results. The 5 low-income group definitions yielded total vulnerable populations ranging from 4\% to 33\% of the county’s population. Almost all of the vulnerable populations lived within a 10-minute drive or bus ride of a low- or medium-cost supermarket. Yet at most 34\% of the vulnerable populations could walk to any supermarket, and as few as 3\% could walk to a low-cost supermarket.

Conclusions. The criteria used to define low-income status and access to supermarkets greatly affect estimates of populations living in food deserts. Measures of access to food must include travel duration and mode and supermarket food costs.},

	abstract = {Access to sustained clean cooking in India is essential to addressing the health burden of indoor air pollution from biomass fuels, but spatial inequality in cities can adversely affect uptake and effectiveness of policies amongst low-income households. Limited data exists on the spatial distribution of energy use in Indian cities, particularly amongst low-income households, and most quantitative studies focus primarily on the effect of economic determinants. A microsimulation approach is proposed, using publicly available data and a Bayesian multi-level model to account for effects of current cooking practices, local socio-cultural context, and spatial effects. This approach offers previously unavailable insight into the spatial distribution of fuel use and residential energy transition within Indian cities. Uncertainty in the modelled effects is propagated through to fuel use estimates. The model is applied to four cities in the south Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and comparison against ward-level survey data shows consistency with the model estimates. Ward-level effects exemplify how wards compare to the city average and to other urban area in the state, which can help stakeholders design and implement clean cooking interventions tailored to the needs of households.},
