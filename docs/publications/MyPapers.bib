	title = {A functional principal components model for internal loads in building energy simulation},
	abstract = {There is currently no established methodology for quantifying uncertainty in occupant-related building internal loads. In this paper, we propose that distinct spaces within a building may be assigned an opera- tional signature comprising the daily base load, load range and diversity profile. A Functional Data Anal- ysis (FDA) approach has been used to analyse moni- tored electricity consumption data for the derivation of such signatures. This approach enables simula- tion of the inherent stochasticity. It represents a step forward towards an ability to propagate uncertainty through a building energy simulation and to quantify the change in electricity consumption associated with a change in building operation.},

abstract = {Significant reduction in energy demand from non-domestic buildings is required if greenhouse emission reduction targets are to be met worldwide. Increasing monitoring of electricity consumption generates a real opportunity for gaining an in-depth understanding of the nature of occupant-related internal loads and the connection between activity and demand. The stochastic nature of the demand is well-known but as yet there is no accepted methodology for generating stochastic loads for building energy simulation. This paper presents evidence that it is feasible to generate stochastic models of activity-related electricity demand based on monitored data. Two machine learning approaches are used to develop stochastic models of plug loads; an autoencoder (AE) and a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) model. Using data from two office buildings located in different countries, the transferability of models is explored by training the models on data from one building and using the trained models to predict demand for the other building. The results show that both models predict plug loads satisfactorily, with a good agreement with the mean demand and quantification of the uncertainty.}

The methodology requires selection of appropriate building simulation tools dependent on the nature of the principal energy demand. This has involved the development of a stand-alone model to simulate the heat flow in botanical glasshouses, as well as stochastic simulation of electricity demand for buildings with high equipment density and occupancy-led operation. Application of the methodology to the buildings at RBG Kew illustrates the potential reduction in energy consumption at the building scale achievable from the application of retrofit measures deemed appropriate for heritage buildings and the potential benefit to be gained from onsite generation and supply of energy.},

  author={Rebecca Mary Ward and Adnan Mortada and Ruchi Choudhary},
  journal={CONTRIBUTIONS TO BUILDING PHYSICS},
  pages={245--252},
  year={2013},
  abstract = { Typical building energy simulation programs do not adequately describe the physical processes of heat and mass transfer which occur in a greenhouse, primarily because they do not include the interaction of the plants with their environment. This is of concern when simulation studies are required in order to assess different options for improving the greenhouse thermal performance. A previous paper (Brown et al 2012) has described the development of a model for simulation of ornamental glasshouses. Further development, in order to represent more accurately the physical processes and assess their significance, is described in this paper. The development has been undertaken in support of retrofit analysis for the glasshouses at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London, which present unique challenges in terms of their historic nature, construction details and design and have provided an opportunity to investigate the relative importance of different physical effects on the energy consumption. Within this context, the simulation has been used to explore options for improving greenhouse thermal performance. },

The study considers the issues that affect simulation at the building scale specific to this site, in particular simulation of heat flow in botanical glasshouses, retrofit of heritage structures and simulation of power load for buildings with high equipment density. In addition, the study considers the potential benefits to be gained from energy microgeneration and supply at the district scale, investigating supply optimisation for a cluster of buildings within the Kew site. }

abstract = {The energy consumption of buildings within which vegetation growth forms a significant function cannot at present be adequately simulated using typical building energy simulation analysis packages as they do not include the ability to simulate the potentially significant heat and mass transfer between plants and the internal air. On the other hand, tools developed for the simulation of climate-controlled greenhouses do not allow multi-zone energy simulation of standard buildings. Within this paper, a model developed for simulating plant growth and crop development within a commercial greenhouse and the corresponding heat, mass and CO2 exchanges is described. A TRNSYS component to facilitate simulation of a building-integrated greenhouse in an urban environment is outlined and a case study of a simple composite office/greenhouse building is presented as a preliminary illustrative ex- ample.},
