Graduate Student
Topic: Designing Energy Flexible Built Environments using Digital Twins
Supervisor: Dr. Ruchi Choudhary

## Biography 
I'm undertaking an MRes + PhD programme exploring the research topics of energy flexibility and digital twins. This work is funded by the EPSRC and Bentley Systems and is held within the CDT in Future Infrastructure and the Built Environment: Resilience in a Changing World (FIBE2).

I'm particularly interested in exploring the use of digital twins as a tool for improving understanding and the operation of the built environment. This is of particular importance in the effort to deliver more energy flexible environments which can help overcome the intermittency issues caused by greater use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.

Before joining the EECi and FIBE2, I undertook an integrated masters in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Leeds. As part of my degree,  I spent a year working in industry for an industrial technology company and a built environment engineering consultancy. I also carried out several research internships within the Soft Robotics Laboratory at Leeds, and one summer research placement at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).
