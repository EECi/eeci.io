## Resarch interests

I am interested in understanding how we can optimise the sustainabilty of our choices under uncertainty, in the context of renewable energy. Currently this is taking the form of exploring the thermal impact of anthropgenic infrastructure on the shallow subsurface and how this affects geothermal potential by using Bayesian calibration techniques on detailed numerical models.


## Background

I hold an MPhys in Physics from Brasenose College, Oxford and an MSc in Sustainable Energy Systems from the University of Edinburgh where I went on to complete my PhD on uncertainty quantification in tidal energy resource assessment.
