## Research interests

My research focuses on improving energy efficiency within healthcare buildings, utilising simulation methods alongside qualitative analysis to develop high-level prototypical models per building archetype. The results of which are intended to streamline the energy intensive ecosystem, improve the internal environment, as well as assessing the existing stock of healthcare buildings within the UK.

## Background

My background is in Architectural Engineering (BSc University of Plymouth) and I am currently working towards an MRes + PhD in Civil Engineering (FIBE2 CDT, University of Cambridge). I have also worked on various projects in a professional capacity, focusing on energy efficiency and decarbonisation in the healthcare, science and technology sector.
