## Research interests

My research interests focus on the optimisation of both the design and operation of renewable energy systems, to enable the decarbonisation of energy usage quickly, cheaply, and reliably. In particular, I'm interested in the impact that uncertainties in renewable generation and future energy demand have on energy system planning, and how those uncertainties can be managed to ensure energy systems remain reliable and affordable as they are decarbonised.

Renewable energy systems are impacted by a host of uncertainties, from inconsistent wind generation to unpredictable energy usage. Data collection can help reduce these uncertainties and improve our ability to design and operate energy systems. But collecting data is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. My publications investigate the benefit that data collection provides to support planning, and tries to identify when it's actually worthwhile.

## Background

My academic background is in optimisation, statistics, and computational science. I hold an MEng degree in Information & Computer Engineering from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in which I achieved a double First. My Master's thesis developed a convex method for optimising the siting and sizing of energy storage assets in a fully renewable power grid, accounting for the full complexity network physics over multiple time instances.

Outside of academics I am an avid hill walker, keen cyclist, and occasional fell runner, though I have a deep love for cake and thoroughly enjoy the results of my baking.
