## Resarch interests

My current research aims to build efficient tools for assisting the decarbonisation of buildings by combining governing heat transfer equations together with powerful Machine Learning tools. In its scope, a Physics-ML synthesis facilitates data-efficient energy representations while maintaining model fidelity and interpretability.

My doctoral research promotes human intelligence as the author of architectural design in the human-computer collaboration. The thesis work adopts ‘Bayesian inference’, to facilitate the interpretability of engineering responses from numerical analysis, with focus on finite element analysis.
