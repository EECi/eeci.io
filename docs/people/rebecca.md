# Research interests
I am interested in how we can use numerical simulation in conjunction with monitored data to improve our understanding, design and operation of the built environment.




# Background

I originally joined the Energy Efficient Cities initiative in April 2011 under a Daphne Jackson Fellowship funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering, to work in the area of energy modelling and simulation with Ruchi. At that time I was investigating the potential to reduce carbon emissions arising from the supply and use of energy in the buildings at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, which involved the environmental performance modelling of individual buildings and the development of a bespoke model for the ornamental glasshouses. 

She is now a part-time Research Associate under the B-bem project, investigating parameterisation of uncertainty in building energy simulation models. She is also a part-time iCase PhD student, sponsored by Laing O'Rourke, investigating stochastic energy simulation of buildings. I hold an MA in Physics from St. Johnâ€™s College, Oxford, and an MSc in Structural Dynamics from Cranfield Institute of Technology. Prior to joining the EECi I worked for Atkins Science and Technology for 13 years.
