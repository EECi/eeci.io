## Brief Bio
I work on energy use in buildings. My research covers simulation-based methodologies for the decarbonisation of buildings; uncertainty quantification in building simulation models; the integration of novel building technologies and renewable energy supply systems; and multi-physics interactions influencing energy consumption of the urban built environment.  I find the use of simulation modelling to investigate interactions among synergistic energy systems in cities especially exciting.

In addition to belonging to the Civil Engineering Department of Cambridge, I am co-Investigator for the Centre of Smart Infrastructure and Construction. I am currently also Group Leader within the Data-centric Engineering Department of the Alan Turing Centre in London on a 100% fellowship (October 2018- March 2022).

Prior to joining Cambridge, I was Assistant Professor of building technologies in the College of Architecture at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, USA (2004-08). I have also taught in the Sustainable and Environmental Design Unit at the Architecture Association in London (2007-09). I received my PhD in Architecture from the University of Michigan in 2004.
