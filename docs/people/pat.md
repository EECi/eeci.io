## Research interests

I am working towards a PhD in Robotics and Autonomous Systems with a focus on the application of artificial intelligence, robotics and physics to controlled environment vertical farming in urban settings. I am currently developing solutions (hardware and software) for automated monitoring and optimisation of energy use and yield.

## Background

My background is in artificial intelligence (MSc Imperial College London), robotics (MSc University of Lincoln) and physics (MSci University of Cambridge). I have worked on a variety of projects from the fabrication and synthesis of semiconductors, superconductors and microfluidic devices to the development of algorithms for quantum computers and the control of drones.
