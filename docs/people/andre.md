## Research interests


## Background
I have an academic background in engineering with a first degree in Mechanical Engineering with Renewable Energy from the University of Edinburgh. I followed this with an MRes in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment at the University of Cambridge with a focus on energy and transport systems.  This led on to my PhD also at the University of Cambridge which focused on understanding and modelling the role of socio-cultural context in residential energy use in cities, and use of data science approaches to characterising barriers and inequality in energy access.

Outside academia I have experience both working in engineering consultancy and building design, as well as the United Nations University - the policy relevant research division of the United Nations.
