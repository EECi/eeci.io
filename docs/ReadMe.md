The folder layout is the following:

* People
    - Mel
    - Monika
    - Rebecca
    - Ruchi
    - etc.
* Projects are organised according to four themes presented at ASG. It contains four subfolders
    - energyplanning
    - stochastic energy modelling (stoch)
    - urban agriculture (urbanag)
    - subsurface environments
* Publications - folder containing .bib files for 'bibbase' publication lists for each person (if applicable), these should be updated regularly
* Repository - __IMPORTANT__, this folder contains documents that are being shared via url for publications, __DO NOT__ alter the path of this folder or delete/move any files. Also be careful not to put large files in here at they will bloat the repository and take up space on everyone's machine

For each folder the figures are stored respectively in:

/Images/

* eplan/
* stoch/
* uag/
* sse/

The main page for each theme is a `splash` page. The individual pages within the splash pages have the `single` layout.
