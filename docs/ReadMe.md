# Folder layout:

The folder layout is the following:

* People
    - Mel
    - Monika
    - Rebecca
    - Ruchi
    - etc.
* Projects are organised according to four themes presented at ASG. It contains four subfolders
    - energyplanning
    - stochastic energy modelling (stoch)
    - urban agriculture (urbanag)
    - subsurface environments

For each folder the figures are stored respectively in:

/Images/

* eplan/
* stoch/
* uag/
* sse/

The main page for each theme is a `splash` page. The individual pages within the splash pages have the `single` layout.
