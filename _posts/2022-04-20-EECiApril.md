excerpt: "A Physics-based Domain Adaptation framework for Energy Modeling and Forecasting in Buildings."
---

As part of the [Physics-based Domain Adaptation project](https://eeci.github.io/home/docs/projects/stoch/statespace/) we are developing a framework to incorporate Physics-based mechanistic knowledge about energy behaviour in buildings into a data-driven framework, to improve energy forecasting timescales. More specifically, our approach incorporates Physics-derived state space models (SSM) into a Domain Adaptation Framework to leverage the generalizability and interpretability innate in the governing structure of the SSM.
