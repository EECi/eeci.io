excerpt: "Virtual race to raise funds for the MS Trust"
---


On 7th March, four team members "went further in 2021" by running their longest run in the year in support of the MS Trust. ALthough the race was virtual, it was really fun to share with the other 40 participants where each of us were running, and everyone was motivated to run their best on a luckily sunny Sunday.

In doing so, we raised over 3500 pounds for the MS Trust, a charity which helps people with their diagnosis throughout their lives. The charity funds MS nurses in hospitals, information, and provides carers for patients with advanced MS. To find out more, here is our fundraising link: www.tinyurl.com/milesforms-fundraise.
