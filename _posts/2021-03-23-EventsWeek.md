*Start of the Data Centric Engineering seminar series*

Co-organised by our very own Zack at the Turing Institute, Data-Centric Engineering are launching **Physics-informed Machine Learning (Φ-ML) Meets Engineering** Seminar Series.

The Data-Centric Engineering programme is launching a new bi-monthly seminar series which aims to explore applications of Φ-ML to engineering practice. “Φ-ML” is an emerging subfield to overcome challenges with interpretability and data-inefficiency of black box ML methods for Engineering applications. In a nutshell, Φ-ML methods aim to integrate known physical understanding of a phenomenon into the ML-learning framework.

Please contact him to find out more about the latest methods in Data-centric engineering, to apply machine learning within the physical modelling space.
