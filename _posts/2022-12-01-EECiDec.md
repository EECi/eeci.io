excerpt: "Annual EECi Christmas gathering."
---

We celebrated our annual Christmas gathering, which included a fun round of secret santa. 

One of the exchaged gifts featured a bespoke EECi board game, created by Mel (previous PhD student, permanent EECi Elf). We had a good first round and Chaoqun was the first winner!
