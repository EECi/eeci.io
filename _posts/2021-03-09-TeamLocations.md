Although we've not seen each other in real life for a year now, we keep in touch with weekly zoom calls! Lockdown may make working harder sometimes, we've found it quite entertaining to keep track of the different cities we've all been working from. As our work is heavily computational, and field work not so easy at the moment, many of us have used this opportunity to spend time with our families as well. 

We hope you also managed to find a suitable place to lockdown this year, and hope you enjoy seeing the many different places our team are from!
