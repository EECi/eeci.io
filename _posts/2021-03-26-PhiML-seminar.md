The Data-Centric Engineering programme is launching a new bi-monthly seminar series which aims to explore applications of Φ-ML to engineering practice. “Φ-ML” is an emerging subfield to overcome challenges with interpretability and data-inefficiency of black box ML methods for Engineering applications. In a nutshell, Φ-ML methods aim to integrate known physical understanding of a phenomenon into the ML-learning framework.
